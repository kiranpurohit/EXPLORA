6157,"To complete a work A and B takes 8 days, B and C takes 12 days, A,B and C takes 6 days. How much
time A and C will take","['A)24 days', 'B)16 days', 'C)12 days', 'D)8 days', 'E)None of these']","Explanation:
A+B 1 day work = 1/8
B+C 1 day work = 1/12
A+B+C 1 day work = 1/6
We can get A work by (A+B+C)-(B+C)
And C by (A+B+C)-(A+B)
So A 1 day work =
16−112=112
Similarly C 1 day work =
16−18=4−324=124
So A and C 1 day work =
112+124=324=18
So A and C can together do this work in 8 days
