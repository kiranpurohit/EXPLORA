In the xy-coordinate plane, which of the following points must lie on the line kx + 2y = 6 for every possible value of k?	"Rationale: To find the points that must lie on the line \(kx + 2y = 6\) for every possible value of \(k\), we need to check which points satisfy this equation regardless of the value of \(k\).

Let's substitute each point into the equation and see if it holds true:

1. For point (1,1):
   \(k(1) + 2(1) = 6\)  
   \(k + 2 = 6\)  
   \(k = 4\)

2. For point (0,3):
   \(k(0) + 2(3) = 6\)  
   \(0 + 6 = 6\)  

3. For point (2,0):
   \(k(2) + 2(0) = 6\)  
   \(2k = 6\)  
   \(k = \frac{6}{2} =3\)

4. For point (3,6):
    k*3+12=9
    k= -3

5. For point (5,-7)
    k*5-14=9
    k=23/5

From our calculations:

Money is paid into an account in portions of $500 and paid out in portions of $300. If after a month the account grew by $1,200, what is the least possible number of transactions that could have been made?	"Rationale: Let's denote the number of $500 portions paid into the account as \(x\) and the number of $300 portions paid out as \(y\). 

Each $500 portion added to the account increases it by $500, and each $300 portion taken out decreases it by $300. 

Given that after a month the account grew by $1,200, we can set up an equation: 
$500x - $300y = $1,200

To find the least possible number of transactions made, we need to minimize both x and y. Since we want to minimize the number of transactions, let's start with smaller values for x and y.

Let's try x = 3 (minimum value) and y = 0:
$500 * 3 - $300 * 0 = $1,500 - 0 =/= $1,200

Next, let's try x = 4 and y = 2:
$500 * 4 - $300 * 2 = $2,000 - $600 =$1,400 /=/ \$1,200

Trying x=5,y=4

There are N numbers of gold biscuits in the house, in which four people are lived. If the first men woke up and divided the biscuits into 5 equal piles and found one extra biscuit. He took one of those piles along with the extra biscuit and hid them. He then gathered the 4 remaining piles into a big pile, woke up the second person and went to sleep. Each of the other 3 persons did the same one by one i.e. divided the big pile into 5 equal piles and found one extra biscuit. Each hid one of the piles along with the extra biscuit and gathered the remaining 4 piles into a big pile. If N>1000, what could be the least value of N?	"Rationale: Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. After the first person divides the biscuits into 5 equal piles, there is one extra biscuit. So, each pile has (N/5) + 1 biscuits.
2. The first person takes one of those piles along with the extra biscuit and hides them. This leaves behind 4 piles with a total of 4 * ((N/5) + 1) = 4N/5 + 4 biscuits.
3. The second person then divides this big pile into 5 equal piles and finds one extra biscuit. Each new pile will have ((4N/5 + 4)/5) + 1 = (4N/25) + (24/5) biscuits.
4. The second person takes one of these new piles along with the extra biscuit and hides them, leaving behind a big pile of size (4N - N)/25 = (3N/25).
5. This process continues for all four people living in the house.

Now, we need to find out what could be the least value of N greater than 1000 that satisfies this scenario.

Let's start by trying some values:
- For N=1000: After all"

The least possible value of |89 - 9a|, where a is an integer, is	"Rationale: To find the least possible value of |89 - 9a|, we need to consider two cases:
1. When 89 - 9a is positive, then |89 - 9a| = 89 - 9a
2. When 89 - 9a is negative, then |89 - 9a| = -(89 - 9a) = 9a - 89

For the first case:
Let's assume that a is such that (89-9a) is positive.
To minimize |89-9a|, we need to maximize the value of a.
The maximum integer value of a can be when a equals the integer part of (89/9), which is equal to approximately 10.

Substitute a =10 into |89-9a| gives us:
|89-90|= |-1|=1

For the second case:
Let's assume that a is such that (89-9a) is negative.
To minimize |(8-a)|, we need to minimize the value of a.
The minimum integer value of a can be when it equals the next lowest integer from (88/(-9)), which is approximately equal to -10.

Substitute a=-10"

M is a set of even numbers from 1 to 23 and odd numbers from 24 to 100. Find no. of zeroes in the sum of all values in the set.	"Rationale: 
To find the sum of all values in the set M, we need to calculate the sum of even numbers from 1 to 23 and odd numbers from 24 to 100 separately.

For even numbers from 1 to 23:
The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: Sum = n/2 * (first term + last term), where n is the number of terms.
In this case, there are \( \frac{23}{2} = 11.5 \) terms (since it's an odd number).
The first term is 2 and the last term is 22.
Sum of even numbers from 1 to 23 = \( \frac{11.5}{2} * (2 + 22) = \frac{11.5}{2} *24 =138\).

For odd numbers from 24 to 100:
Similarly, we calculate the sum using the same formula.
There are \( \frac{77}{2} =38.5\) terms between these two ranges.
The first term is 25 and the last term is also an odd number which is less than or equal to but closest to a multiple of four greater than or equal to one hundred i.e.,99"

"A circular gear with a diameter of 25 cm is mounted directly over another circular gear with a diameter of 100 cm. Both gears run on the same axle at their exact centers and each gear has a single notch at the 12 o'clock position. At the same moment, the gears start to rotate at the same rate in cm/s, with the larger gear moving clockwise and the smaller gear moving anticlockwise.
How far in centimeters will the notch on the larger gear have moved the second time the notches pass each other?"	"Rationale: 
Let's first find the circumference of each gear using the formula for the circumference of a circle, which is given by \(C = \pi \times d\), where \(d\) is the diameter.

For the larger gear with a diameter of 100 cm:
\(C_{100} = \pi \times 100 = 100\pi\) cm

For the smaller gear with a diameter of 25 cm:
\(C_{25} = \pi \times 25 = 25\pi\) cm

Since both gears are moving in opposite directions and have notches at their centers, they will meet every time one complete revolution has been made by both gears. The larger gear completes one full rotation when it moves its circumference distance. Similarly, the smaller gear completes one full rotation when it moves its circumference distance.

When they meet again, it means that both gears have completed an equal number of rotations. Therefore, we need to find how far along each gear's circumference they have moved when they meet again.

The notch on the larger gear will move \(C_{100}\) (circumference of larger gear) while the notch on the smaller gear will move \(C_{25}\) (circumference of smaller gear).

Of the new vehicles registered in a week, 300 were neither SUVs nor were they powered by diesel. 3/4th of the SUVs registered were diesel powered and there were half as many SUVs as there were non SUVs. If SUVs not powered by diesel were a sixth of non SUVs not powered by diesel, how many vehicles V registered in the week were powered by diesel?	"Rationale: Let's break down the information given in the question:
- Total new vehicles registered = V
- Vehicles that were neither SUVs nor diesel-powered = 300
- 3/4th of SUVs were diesel-powered, so 1/4th were not.
- Number of SUVs = 1/2 * number of non-SUVs
- Number of SUVs not powered by diesel = 1/6 * number of non-SUVs not powered by diesel

Let's denote:
Non-SUVs as N,
SUVs as S,
Diesel-powered vehicles as D,
Non-diesel-powered vehicles as ND.

From the information provided, we can write equations:
N + S = V (Total vehicles)
N + S = 300 (Vehicles that were neither SUV nor diesel)
S = N / 2 (Number of SUVs is half the number of non-SUVs)
D(S) + ND(S) = V - 300 (Total SUV and non-SUV vehicles)

Now let's substitute and solve for D(S):
D(S) + ND(S) = V - 300
3/4 * S + 1/4 * S + (5/6 * N)/2 +"

The spherical ball of lead 3 cm in diameter is melted and recast into 3 spherical balls. The diameters of two of these are 1 1/2 cm and 2 cm respectively. The diameter of third ball is?	"Rationale: 
Let's consider the volume of lead in the original spherical ball is equal to the sum of volumes of the three new spherical balls.

Volume of a sphere = (4/3) * π * r^3, where r is the radius.

Given that the original ball has a diameter of 3 cm, so its radius is 1.5 cm.
Volume of original ball = (4/3) * π * (1.5)^3

Now, for the three new balls:
Let d be the diameter of the third ball, so its radius will be d/2.

Volumes:
1. Volume of first new ball with diameter 1 1/2 cm = (4/3) * π * ((1.5)/2)^3
2. Volume of second new ball with diameter 2 cm = (4/3) * π * (1)^3
3. Volume of third new ball with diameter d = (4/3) * π * ((d)/2)^3

Since all these volumes should add up:

(4/3)π*(1.5)^3 = [(4/3)*π*((1.5)/2)^3] + [(4/3)*π*(1"

At an amusement park, tom bought a number of red tokens and green tokens. Each red token costs $0.05, and each green token costs $0.14. If Tom spent a total of exactly $2.06, how many token in total did Tom buy?	"Rationale: Let the number of red tokens be x and the number of green tokens be y.

The total cost equation can be represented as:
0.05x + 0.14y = 2.06

We are looking for the total number of tokens, so x + y needs to be found.

To solve this system of equations, we need to find values for x and y that satisfy both equations.

Given that Tom spent a total of $2.06, we can substitute this value into the equation:

0.05x + 0.14y = 2.06
5x + 14y = 206 (multiplying by 100 to get rid of decimals)

Now, there could be multiple ways to approach solving this system based on personal preference or comfort with different methods like substitution or elimination method.

Let's use substitution method here:
From the given information in the question stem, it is not explicitly mentioned how many red and green tokens were bought by Tom.
So let's assume some values for x (number of red tokens) and then calculate corresponding y (number of green tokens).

Let's start with assuming x = 20 (just as an example):
5(20) + 14y = 206

A fisherman's day is rated as good if he catches 9 fishes, fair if he catches 7 fishes and poor if he catches 5 fishes. The fisherman catches 53 fishes in a week that includes good, fair and poor days. How many good days the fisherman had during the week?	"Rationale: Let's denote the number of good, fair, and poor days as G, F, and P respectively.

Given:
G + F + P = 7 (total number of days in a week)
9G + 7F + 5P = 53 (total number of fishes caught)

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the value of G.

From the first equation:
P = 7 - G - F

Substitute this into the second equation:
9G + 7F + 5(7 - G - F) = 53
9G + 7F + 35 - 5G - 5F = 53
4G + 2F =18
2G + F =9

Since we are looking for the number of good days (G), let's try different values for G starting from option A:

A) If there is only one good day (G=1):
2(1) + F =9
2+F=9
F=7

This doesn't satisfy our initial equations. 

B) If there are two good days (G=2):
2(2) + F =9
4+F=9 
F=5

This satisfies"

A, B and C start at the same time in the same direction to run around a circular stadium. A completes a round in 252 seconds, B in 308 seconds and c in 198 seconds, all starting at the same point. After what time will they again at the starting point ?	"Rationale: To find the time when A, B, and C will meet again at the starting point, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their individual times taken to complete one round around the circular stadium.

Given:
A completes a round in 252 seconds,
B completes a round in 308 seconds,
C completes a round in 198 seconds.

We need to find the LCM of 252, 308, and 198.

Step-by-step calculation for finding LCM:
1. Prime factorize each number:
   - 252 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 7
   - 308 = 2^2 * 7 * 11
   - 198 = 2 *3^2*11

2. Identify all unique prime factors with their highest powers from all numbers:
   - Prime factors: {2,3,7,11}
   - Highest powers: {2^2 ,3^2 ,7 ,11}

3. Multiply these prime factors with their highest powers to get LCM:
   LCM = (2^2) * (3^2) * (7) * (11)
       = (4) * (9) *(77"

Consider a courier company A which can deliver 100 parcels in 5 days with 5 men working for 8 hours a day. Consider another courier company B where every employee is equally efficient as that of company B. Company B is short of one man when compared to A and has a policy of asking its workers to work only for 6 hours a day. How long (in days) company B will take to deliver 100 parcels.	"Rationale: Let's first find the total work done by company A in one day. Company A delivers 100 parcels in 5 days with 5 men working for 8 hours a day, so the total work done by company A in one day is:

Total work done by A in one day = (100 parcels) / (5 days) = 20 parcels per day

Now, let's find out how much work each man of company A does in one hour:

Work done by each man of A in one hour = 20 parcels / (5 men * 8 hours) = 0.5 parcel per hour

Since every employee of company B is equally efficient as that of company A and there is a shortage of one man compared to company A, the number of men working for B will be (5 - 1) = 4 men.

Now, let's calculate how long it will take for company B to deliver 100 parcels when each worker works for only 6 hours a day:

Number of parcels delivered by B in one hour = Work done by each man * Number of men
Number of parcels delivered by B in one hour = (0.5 parcel/hour) * (4 men) = 2 parcels/hour

Davji Shop sells samosas in boxes of different sizes. The samosas are priced at Rs. 2 per samosa up to 200 samosas. For every additional 20 samosas, the price of the whole lot goes down by 10 paise per samosa. What should be the maximum size of the box that would maximise the revenue?	"Rationale: Let's calculate the revenue for each box size to find the maximum revenue.

Let's assume x as the number of samosas in a box. The price per samosa is Rs. 2 up to 200 samosas, and then it decreases by 10 paise (Rs. 0.10) for every additional 20 samosas.

For the first 200 samosas:
Revenue = Price per samosa * Number of samosas
Revenue = Rs. 2 * min(x, 200)

For additional samosas beyond the first 200:
Number of additional sets of 20 = max(0, (x - 200) / 20)
Price reduction per set = Rs. 0.10
Total reduction in price = Price reduction per set * Number of additional sets
New price per samosa after discount = Rs. (2 - Total reduction in price)

Total Revenue for x number of samosas:
If x <= 200,
Total Revenue = Rs. (2 * x)
If x > 200,
Total Revenue = [Rs.(400) + (x-200)*1*(x>220)] - [(x-220)*0.1*(x>220)]

Now we can calculate this expression for"

Equal quantities of three mixtures of milk and water are mixed in the ratio 1:2, 2:3 and 3:4. The ratio of water and milk in the mixture is:	"Rationale: To find the ratio of water and milk in the final mixture, we need to consider the quantities of milk and water in each of the three mixtures being mixed.

Let's assume that equal quantities of each mixture are taken. This assumption simplifies calculations and does not affect the final ratio.

For the first mixture with a ratio of 1:2 (milk:water), if we take 1 unit of milk, then there are 2 units of water.
For the second mixture with a ratio of 2:3 (milk:water), if we take 2 units of milk, then there are 3 units of water.
For the third mixture with a ratio of 3:4 (milk:water), if we take 3 units of milk, then there are 4 units of water.

Adding up all these components:
Milk = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
Water = 2 + 3 +4 =9

So, in total, after mixing all three equal quantities:
Total Milk = (1+2+3) x Equal Quantity
Total Water =(2+3+4)x Equal Quantity

Therefore, The ratio is Total Water : Total Milk=9x :6x"

Find the cost of carpeting a room 13 m long and 9 m broad with a carpet 75 cm wide at the rate of Rs. 12.40 per square metre.	"Rationale: 
To find the area to be carpeted, we first need to calculate the total area of the room and then subtract the area not to be carpeted (area covered by furniture or other objects).

Given:
Length of the room = 13 m
Breadth of the room = 9 m
Width of carpet = 75 cm = 0.75 m
Cost per square meter = Rs. 12.40

1. Calculate total area of the room:
Total Area = Length x Breadth
Total Area = 13m x 9m
Total Area = 117 sq.m

2. Calculate area not to be carpeted:
Area not to be carpeted is equal to the length and breadth reduced by twice the width of the carpet.
Area not to be carpeted = (13 - 2*0.75) x (9 - 2*0.75)
Area not to be carpeted = (11.5) x (7.5)
Area not to be carpeted ≈ 86.25 sq.m

3. Calculate final area to be carpeted:
Final Area = Total Area - Area not to be carpeted
Final Area ≈117 sq.m - 86.25 sq"
