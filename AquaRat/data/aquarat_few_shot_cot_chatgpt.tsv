Three birds are flying at a fast rate of 900 kilometers per hour. What is their speed in miles per minute? [1km = 0.6 miles]	"To find the speed of the birds in miles per minute, we first need to convert their speed from kilometers per hour to miles per hour and then to miles per minute.

Given:
Speed of birds = 900 km/hr
Conversion factor: 1 km = 0.6 miles

Step 1: Convert speed from kilometers per hour to miles per hour
Speed in miles per hour = Speed in km/hr * Conversion factor
Speed in miles per hour = 900 km/hr * 0.6 miles/km
Speed in miles per hour = 540 miles/hr

Step 2: Convert speed from miles per hour to miles per minute
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour,
Speed in miles per minute = Speed in miles per hour / 60
Speed in miles per minute = 540 / 60
Speed in miles per minute = 9

Therefore, the speed of the birds is 9 miles per minute.

A ship is leaving a port. It takes 240 seconds to passes through a 750m channel to get to the port gates, and takes 60 seconds to pass through the gates of the port. What is its length?	"Given:
Time taken to pass through the 750m channel = 240 seconds
Time taken to pass through the gates of the port = 60 seconds

Let's denote:
Length of the ship as L meters

To calculate the length of the ship, we can use the concept of speed = distance/time.

Speed in channel = Distance in channel / Time in channel
Speed at gates = Distance at gates / Time at gates

Since speed remains constant,
Speed in channel = Speed at gates

Distance in channel / Time in channel = Distance at gates / Time at gates

Using this information, we can set up two equations:

1. L / 240 = 750 / 240 (for passing through the channel)
2. L / 60 = x (for passing through the gates)

Solving these equations will give us the length of the ship.

Rationale: The time it takes for a ship to pass through a certain distance is inversely proportional to its length. So, by setting up and solving these two equations, we can find out how long the ship is.

Answer: D)250 m"
A rectangular piece of cloth 2 feet wide was cut lengthwise into two smaller rectangular pieces. The shorter piece was one-third of the length of the longer of the 2 new pieces and had an area of 12 square feet. What was the length Q in feet of the original piece of cloth before cutting?	"Given:
- Width of the original rectangular piece of cloth = 2 feet
- Area of the shorter piece after cutting = 12 square feet
- The shorter piece is one-third the length of the longer new piece

Let's denote:
- Length of the longer new piece as L
- Length of the shorter new piece as (1/3)L

The area formula for a rectangle is: Area = Length * Width

Since we have two pieces from cutting, their areas add up to give the area of the original piece:
(1/3)L * 2 + (2 - 1/3)L * 2 = L * 2

Now, we know that the area of the shorter piece is given as 12 square feet. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

(1/3)L * 2 = 12
(2/3)L = 12
L = (12*3)/2
L = 18 feet

Therefore, before cutting, the length Q in feet of the original piece was indeed **18**.

A travel company wants to charter a plane to the Bahamas. Chartering the plane costs $5,000. So far, 12 people have signed up for the trip. If the company charges $200 per ticket, how many more passengers must sign up for the trip before the company can make any profit on the charter?	"To find out how many more passengers must sign up for the trip before the company can make any profit on the charter, we need to calculate the total revenue and compare it with the cost.

Given:
- Chartering the plane costs $5,000.
- 12 people have signed up for the trip.
- The company charges $200 per ticket.

Let's calculate:
Total cost = Chartering cost = $5,000
Total revenue from 12 people who have signed up = 12 * $200

Now let's check if there is any profit made:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost

We need to find out when Profit becomes positive. Let x be the number of additional passengers needed to make a profit.

Total revenue from x additional passengers at $200 per ticket = x * $200

Therefore,
Profit equation: (12 + x) * $200 - $5,000 > 0
Solve for x:

(12 + x) * 200 - 5000 > 0
2400 + 200x - 5000 > 0
200x > 2600
x > 13

So, at least **14** more passengers must sign up for the trip before the company can make any profit on"
Kirk sells cars. On two sales, Kirk has received commissions of $850, and $705, and he has one additional sale pending. If Kirk is to receive an average (arithmetic mean) commission of exactly $820 on the three sales, then the third commission must be:	"Given that Kirk has received commissions of $850 and $705 on two sales, and he has one additional sale pending. 

Let the third commission be x.

To find the average commission of exactly $820 on the three sales, we can set up an equation:

(850 + 705 + x) / 3 = 820

Solving for x:
1555 + x = 2460
x = 2460 - 1555
x = 905

Therefore, the third commission must be $905.

Answer: B)$905"
A group of 5 friends were to contribute equally to purchase items from a store. If store offered them a promotional discount of 15%, how much did each friend pay, given a total bill of $ 1200?	"To find out how much each friend paid after the promotional discount, we first need to calculate the total amount after the discount and then divide it equally among the 5 friends.

Given:
Total bill before discount = $1200
Promotional discount = 15%

Step 1: Calculate the total amount after the 15% discount.
Discounted amount = Total bill - (15% of Total bill)
Discounted amount = $1200 - (0.15 * $1200)
Discounted amount = $1200 - $180
Discounted amount = $1020

Step 2: Divide the discounted amount equally among the 5 friends.
Amount each friend pays = Discounted amount / Number of friends
Amount each friend pays = $1020 / 5
Amount each friend pays = $204

Therefore, each friend paid $204.

"Let A, B and C denote the vertices of a triangle with area 10. Let point D be on side AB,
point E be on side BC and point F be on side CA with AD = 2 and DB = 3. The area of
△ABE and the area of quadrilateral DBEF are the same. What is the value of this area?"	"Given:
AD = 2
DB = 3
Area of triangle ABC = 10

Let x be the length of AE. Then BE will be equal to 5 - x.

The area of triangle ABE can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle given its base and height:
Area of triangle ABE = (1/2) * AE * BE

The area of quadrilateral DBEF can be found by subtracting the areas of triangles ABE and BDE from the total area of triangle ABC:
Area of quadrilateral DBEF = Area of triangle ABC - Area of triangle ABE - Area of triangle BDE

We know that the areas of triangles ABE and DBE are equal, so we can simplify this expression:
Area of quadrilateral DBEF = Area of triangle ABC - 2 * Area of triangle ABE

Now, let's substitute the given values into these formulas:

1. Calculate the area of triangle ABE:
AE = x
BE = 5 - x
Area_ABE = (1/2) * x * (5-x)

2. Calculate the area_of_quadrilateral DBEF using the above calculations:

ABC company pays an average of $120 per vehicle each month in outdoor parking fees for three of its eight vehicles. The company pays garage parking fees for the remaining five vehicles. If ABC pays an average of $240 per vehicle overall each month for parking, how much does ABC pay per month in garage parking fees for its vehicles?	"Let's denote the total amount paid for garage parking fees for the five vehicles as x.

The total amount paid for outdoor parking fees for three vehicles is 3 * $120 = $360.

The total amount paid for garage parking fees for five vehicles is 5x.

The overall monthly parking cost is the sum of outdoor and garage parking fees, which is $240 per vehicle. So, we can set up an equation:

(360 + 5x) / 8 = $240

Now, let's solve for x:

360 + 5x = 8 * $240
360 + 5x = $1920
5x = $1920 - $360
5x = $1560
x = $1560 / 5
x = $312

Therefore, ABC pays $312 per month in garage parking fees for its vehicles.

Solution A has 5% salt concentration and remaining water. After heating 50 litres of Solution A at a certain temperature, due to evaporation, the salt concentration increases to 10%. The amount of water remaining in the solution would be	"To solve this question, we need to understand that the amount of salt in the solution remains constant before and after heating. 

Let's denote the initial amount of salt in Solution A as S liters and the initial amount of water as W liters.

Initially, Solution A has a 5% salt concentration:
- Amount of salt = 0.05 * 50 = 2.5 liters
- Amount of water = 50 - 2.5 = 47.5 liters

After heating, the salt concentration becomes 10%:
- Total volume after heating = 50 liters
- Amount of salt remains at S liters
- Amount of water remaining = Total volume - Amount of salt = 50 - S

Since the total amount of salt remains constant:
- Initial amount of salt + Evaporated water (which is pure) should equal final amount of salt: 
2.5 + (47.5 - evaporated water) = S

Solving for S gives us:
S = evaporation_water + (47.5)

Given that after evaporation, the remaining solution has a total volume of 50 liters with a new concentration,
we can write it as:
S / (evaporation_water + (47.5))=10/"
If a number of apples, say x, is divisible by 3 and 9, x is a multiple of which of the following values?	"To find which values x is a multiple of, given that x is divisible by both 3 and 9, we need to find the common multiples of 3 and 9.

Common multiples of 3 and 9 are numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 9. The smallest common multiple of two numbers is their least common multiple (LCM).

The LCM of 3 and 9 is the smallest number that is divisible by both 3 and 9, which in this case is simply the larger number, which is 9.

Therefore, if a number x is divisible by both 3 and 9, it must be a multiple of:

In how many arrangements can you arrange 3 green cones and 3 blue cones in a line along the boundary of football ground if no two cones of the same color are to be adjacent?	"To solve this problem, we can consider the arrangement of the cones in two steps:

Step 1: Arrange the green cones
Since no two cones of the same color can be adjacent, we must alternate between green and blue cones. We have 3 green cones to arrange. The number of ways to arrange them is equivalent to arranging 3 objects (green cones) in 3 slots (positions between blue cones). This can be done in 3! = 6 ways.

Step 2: Arrange the blue cones
After placing the green cones, we are left with spaces for the blue cones. We have 3 blue cones to arrange. Similarly, this is equivalent to arranging 3 objects (blue cones) in 3 slots (positions between green cones). This can also be done in 3! = 6 ways.

Therefore, the total number of arrangements for both colors is obtained by multiplying the number of arrangements from Step 1 and Step 2:
Total arrangements = Number of arrangements for green * Number of arrangements for blue
Total arrangements = 6 * 6 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of **36** possible arrangements where no two cones of the same color are adjacent.

In a mixture, the ratio of spirit and water is 3:2. If the amount of spirit is 3 litre more than amount of water, calculate the amount of spirit in mixture?	"Given that the ratio of spirit to water in the mixture is 3:2. Let's assume the amount of spirit in the mixture is \(3x\) liters and the amount of water is \(2x\) liters.

It is also given that the amount of spirit is 3 liters more than the amount of water:
\[3x = 2x + 3\]
\[x = 3\]

Now, we can find the amount of spirit in the mixture:
Amount of spirit = \(3 \times x = 3 \times 3 = 9\) liters

A car traveled 40 mph from Belnap to Lincoln and 50 mph from Lincoln to Belnap. If the whole trip was 660 miles, how long did the round trip take?	"Given:
- Speed from Belnap to Lincoln = 40 mph
- Speed from Lincoln to Belnap = 50 mph
- Total distance for the round trip = 660 miles

Let's denote the time taken to travel from Belnap to Lincoln as \( t_1 \) and the time taken to travel from Lincoln to Belnap as \( t_2 \).

We know that Distance = Speed * Time. So, we can write two equations based on the given information:
1. \( 40t_1 + 50t_2 = 660 \) (Total distance equation)
2. \( t_1 + t_2 = \text{Total time for round trip} \)

To find the total time for the round trip, we need to solve these two equations simultaneously.

From equation (2), we can express \( t_1 \) in terms of \( t_2 \):
\( t_1 = (\text{Total time}) - t_2 \)

Substitute this into equation (1):
\( 40((\text{Total time}) - t_2) + 50t_2 = 660 \)
\( 40(\text{Total time}) - 40t_2 + 50t"
In a certain conservative mutual fund, 60 percent of the money is invested in bonds, and of that portion, 40 percent is invested in highly rated corporate bonds. If at least $2.4 million in this fund is invested in highly rated corporate bonds, what is the smallest possible total value for the mutual fund?	"To find the smallest possible total value for the mutual fund, we need to consider the scenario where only the minimum required amount is invested in highly rated corporate bonds.

Let's assume the total value of the mutual fund is x million dollars. 
- 60% of x is invested in bonds.
- 40% of that portion (0.4 * 0.6x) is invested in highly rated corporate bonds.

Given that at least $2.4 million is invested in highly rated corporate bonds:
0.4 * 0.6x ≥ 2.4
0.24x ≥ 2.4
x ≥ 2.4 / 0.24
x ≥ 10

So, the smallest possible total value for the mutual fund is $10 million.

Therefore, Answer: B)10 million"
A certain state imposes a 4% tax on the nightly rates of hotel room. A certain hotel in this state also charges a $2.00 nightly fee per room, which is not subject to tax. If the total charge for a room for one night was $72.72 , what was the nightly rate of the room?	"To find the nightly rate of the room, we need to consider that the total charge includes both the nightly rate and the $2.00 fee per room.

Let x be the nightly rate of the room.

Given:
- 4% tax is imposed on the nightly rates.
- $2.00 nightly fee per room is not subject to tax.
- Total charge for a room for one night was $72.72.

So, we can set up an equation:
Nightly rate + $2.00 fee + 4% tax on nightly rate = Total charge
x + 2 + 0.04x = 72.72
1.04x = 70.72
x = 70.72 / 1.04
x ≈ $68

Therefore, the nightly rate of the room was approximately $68.

Alex has enough money to buy 30 bricks. If the bricks each cost 20 cents less, Grace could buy 10 more bricks. How much money does Grace have to spend on bricks?	"Let's denote the cost of each brick as x cents.

According to the given information:
Alex can buy 30 bricks, so Alex spends 30x cents.
Grace could buy 10 more bricks if each brick costs 20 cents less, which means Grace would spend (30 + 10)x = 40x cents.

Given that Alex and Grace spend the same amount on bricks:
30x = 40x
Solving for x:
-10x = 0
x = $0

Now we know that each brick originally costs $0. 

To find out how much money Grace has to spend on bricks:
If each brick costs $0.20 less than before, then Grace needs to pay $0 - $0.20 = -$0.20 per brick.
Since it doesn't make sense for the price of a brick to be negative, there seems to be an error in the question or calculations provided.

Therefore, based on this analysis, it is not possible to determine how much money Grace has to spend on bricks with the given information and options."
In a poll of 45,000 dentists, only 30 percent responded; of these, 20 percent claimed to prefer Toothpaste A. How many of the dentists who responded did not claim a preference for Toothpaste A?	"To find the number of dentists who responded and preferred Toothpaste A, we first calculate the total number of dentists who preferred Toothpaste A:

Total dentists = 45,000
Percentage who responded = 30%
Number of responding dentists = 30% of 45,000 = 0.30 * 45,000

Out of those who responded:
Percentage who preferred Toothpaste A = 20%
Number of dentists who preferred Toothpaste A = 20% of (0.30 * 45,000) = 0.20 * (0.30 * 45,000)

Now to find the number of dentists who responded but did not prefer Toothpaste A:
Number of dentists who did not prefer Toothpaste A = Number of responding dentists - Number of dentists who preferred Toothpaste A

Let's calculate this step by step:

1. Calculate the number of responding dentists:
Number of responding dentists = 0.30 * 45,000

2. Calculate the number of dentists who preferred Toothpaste A:
Number of dentists preferring Toothpaste A = 0.20 * (0.30 * 45,000)

"In recent Malta elections, in a particular constituency, 100,000 votes were cast and each vote was cast for
either Candidate A or Candidate B. If candidate A has won by 500 votes, what percent of the 100,000 votes
were cast for Candidate A?"	"To find the percentage of votes cast for Candidate A, we first need to determine how many votes Candidate A received.

Given that Candidate A won by 500 votes and there were a total of 100,000 votes cast, we can calculate the number of votes received by Candidate A as follows:

Number of votes for Candidate A = Total number of votes - Number of votes by which Candidate A won
Number of votes for Candidate A = 100,000 - 500
Number of votes for Candidate A = 99,500

Now, to find the percentage of votes cast for Candidate A out of the total 100,000 votes:

Percentage = (Number of votes for Candidate A / Total number of votes) * 100%
Percentage = (99,500 / 100,000) * 100%
Percentage ≈ 99.5%

Therefore, approximately 99.5% of the 100,000 votes were cast for Candidate A.

Glenn gains 10% from selling her scarf at $44. Her mom tells her she'll buy it from her but only after a family discount of 5%. What is Glenn's gain percent if she sells the scarf to her mom?	"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Glenn sells her scarf at $44 and gains 10%.
   So, the selling price after a 10% gain = $44.
   Let x be the cost price of the scarf.
   Selling Price = Cost Price + Gain
                44 = x + 0.10x
                44 = 1.10x
                x = 44 / 1.10
                x ≈ $40 (Cost Price)

2. Her mom buys it from her with a family discount of 5%.
   The discounted price her mom pays for the scarf:
   Discounted Price = Selling Price - Discount
                    = $44 - (5% of $44)
                    = $44 - (0.05 * $44)
                    ≈ $41.80

3. Glenn's gain when she sells the scarf to her mom:
   Gain % = [(Selling Price - Cost Price) / Cost Price] * 100%
          = [($41.80 - $40) / $40] *100%
          ≈ [($1.80) / $40] *100%

A trader bought some books for Rs 8 each. The wholesaler gave 15% discount on each of the books. If the discount amount deducted on the bill was Rs 216, how many books did he buy?	"Let's break down the given information and solve the problem step by step:

Let the number of books bought be x.

Cost price of each book = Rs 8

Total cost without discount = Cost price * Number of books = 8x

Discount rate = 15%

Discount amount on each book = 15% of Rs 8 = (15/100) * 8 = Rs 1.20

Given that the total discount amount deducted on the bill was Rs 216, we can set up an equation:

Total discount amount = Discount per book * Number of books
216 = 1.20x

A group of stock analysts had a contest. Each analyst picked 5 stocks out of a list of 30 stocks to purchase. If each of the stocks was picked exactly 6 times, how many analysts were in the contest?	"Let's break down the information given in the question:
- Each analyst picked 5 stocks.
- Each stock was picked exactly 6 times.

To find out how many analysts were in the contest, we can set up an equation based on the total number of stock selections made by all analysts.

Total number of stock selections = Number of analysts * Number of stocks each analyst picked

Since each stock was picked exactly 6 times and there are a total of 30 stocks, the total number of stock selections is:
30 stocks * 6 picks per stock = 180 total picks

Each analyst picked 5 stocks, so for each analyst:
5 picks per analyst

Let's denote the number of analysts as x. Therefore, the total number of picks made by all analysts would be:
Total picks = Number of analysts * Picks per analyst

- If two tractors are moved to another field, then the remaining 4 tractors could plough the same field in 5 days.

Let's denote the number of hectares one tractor would plough per day as x.

From the information given, we can set up equations based on the work done by the tractors:

1. For all 6 tractors working together:
6 * 120 = total area ploughed in a day

2. For just 4 tractors working after moving two:
4 * x = total area ploughed in a day

Using these equations and information about days taken for both scenarios, we can solve for x.

Rationale:
If all six tractors each ploughing at a rate of 120 hectares/day cover an entire field in four days, then they collectively cover \(6 \times 120 \times 4\) hectares. This gives us the total area of the field.

When only four out of those six tractors are left to complete that same field over five days, their combined daily rate is \(4x"
On sports day, if 24 children were made to stand in a column, then 10 columns could be formed. If 240 children were made to stand in a column, then how many columns could be formed?	"Let's analyze the given information step by step:

Given:
- 24 children can form 10 columns.
- We need to find out how many columns can be formed with 240 children.

Let's first calculate how many children are there in each column when 24 children form 10 columns:
Number of children in each column = Total number of children / Number of columns
Number of children in each column = 24 / 10
Number of children in each column = 2.4 (This means there are approximately 2.4 children per column)

Now, we want to find out how many columns can be formed with 240 children:
Number of columns = Total number of children / Number of children in each column
Number of columns = 240 / 2.4
Number of columns = 100

Therefore, when 240 children are made to stand in a column, we can form **100** columns.

The salaries of Kiran, Prakash and Sanjay are in the ratio of 2 : 3 : 4. The salary of Prakash and Sanjay together is Rs. 56000. The manager plans to increment the salary of Prakash from his current package and does so by increasing his salary so that it is 1 rupee more than that of Sanjay. Now, if Kiran wishes to demand a salary that will surpass Prakash's by 1 Rupee, how much he should demand ?	"Given:
Salaries ratio of Kiran, Prakash, and Sanjay = 2 : 3 : 4
Let the common multiplier be x.
So, their salaries are 2x, 3x, and 4x respectively.

It is given that the salary of Prakash and Sanjay together is Rs. 56000.
Therefore,
3x + 4x = 56000
7x = 56000
x = 8000

Now we can find their individual salaries:
Kiran's salary = 2 * x = Rs. (2 * 8000) = Rs.16000
Prakash's salary = 3 * x = Rs. (3 *8000) = Rs.24000
Sanjay's salary = 4 * x= Rs. (4*8000) = Rs.32000

After incrementing Prakash's salary so that it is one rupee more than Sanjay's:
New salary of Prakash will be: Rs.(32000 +1) = Rs.32001

To surpass Prakash by one rupee, Kiran should demand a salary of:
Rs.(24001 +1) 
=Rs.24002

Therefore, Kiran should demand"
A wholesaler allows a discount of 20 % on the list price to the retailer. The retailer sells at 5% below the list price. If the customer pays Rs.19 for an article what profit is made by the retailer on it?	"Given:
- The wholesaler allows a 20% discount on the list price to the retailer.
- The retailer sells at 5% below the list price.
- The customer pays Rs.19 for an article.

Let's denote:
- List price = L

The amount paid by the customer is after both discounts, so we need to calculate it step by step:

1. After a 20% discount from the wholesaler, the retailer pays 80% of the list price:
Retailer's cost = 0.8 * L

2. The retailer then sells at 5% below this cost:
Selling price = Retailer's cost - (5% of Retailer's cost)
Selling price = Retailer's cost - (0.05 * Retailer's cost)
Selling price = Retailer's cost - 0.05 * 0.8L
Selling price = 0.95 * Retailer's cost

3. Given that the customer pays Rs.19 for an article, we have:
Selling price = Rs.19

Now, equating Selling Price to Rs.19 with our calculations above:

0.95 * Retailer's cost = Rs.19
0.95 * 0."
"A cube shaped pool is half full of water. If the water is 36 inches deep, how much would the
water in the pool weigh if the pool were filled to the brim? (1 cubic foot weighs 56 pounds)"	"To find the weight of the water in the pool when it is filled to the brim, we first need to calculate the volume of water in the pool.

Given:
- The pool is half full, so its total depth is 36 inches.
- The pool is cube-shaped.

Let's denote:
- Side length of the cube = x inches
- Depth of water in half-filled pool = 36 inches

Since the pool is half full, then its depth when completely filled will be 2 * 36 = 72 inches.

The volume of water in a cube-shaped pool can be calculated using:
Volume = side length * side length * depth

For a half-filled cube-shaped pool:
Volume = x * x * 36 cubic inches

When filled to the brim:
Volume = x * x * 72 cubic inches

Given that 1 cubic foot weighs 56 pounds, we need to convert cubic inches to cubic feet and then calculate the weight of water:

1 cubic foot = (12*12*12) cubic inches
So, weight per unit volume = (56 pounds / (12*12*12) cubic inches)

Now, let's substitute values and solve for weight:

Weight when filled to brim = (x*x*72"
A car after covering 1/2 of a journey of 100 km develops engine trouble and later travels at 1/2 of its original speed. As a result, it arrives 2 hours late than its normal time. What is the normal speed of the car is?	"Let the normal speed of the car be x km/hr.

Given that the car covers half of the journey at its normal speed and half at half its original speed. 

The time taken to cover the first half of the journey at normal speed = (50 / x) hours

The time taken to cover the second half of the journey at half its original speed = (50 / (x/2)) = 100 / x hours

Given that due to engine trouble, it arrives 2 hours late than its normal time:

(50 / x) + (100 / x) = 100 / x + 2

Solving this equation gives:

(50/x) + (200/x) = 100/x + 2
250/x = 100/x + 2
150/x = 2
x = 150/2
x =75 km/hr

Therefore, the normal speed of the car is 75 km/hr.

At an elite baseball camp, 60% of players can bat both right-handed and left-handed. If 1/3 of the players who bat left-handed do not bat right-handed, what is the probability that a player selected at random does not bat left-handed?	"Let's break down the information given in the question:

1. 60% of players can bat both right-handed and left-handed.
2. 1/3 of the players who bat left-handed do not bat right-handed.

To find the probability that a player selected at random does not bat left-handed, we need to consider two cases:
- Players who can bat both right-handed and left-handed
- Players who only bat right-handed

Let's denote:
- Total players = 100 (for easier calculation)
- Players who can bat both ways = 60
- Players who only bat left-handed = x
- Players who only bat right-handed = y

From the given information:
x + y = 40 (since total players - those who can bat both ways)

Now, we know that 1/3 of the players who bat left-handed do not bat right-handed. This means out of x (players who only bat left), x/3 do not also bat right.

So, y = x/3

Substitute this into our previous equation:
x + x/3 = 40
Multiplying by 3 to clear fractions:
3x + x = 120
4x = 120
x = 30

One person has 2 children. At least one of them was a girl. Then the probability that 2 of the are girl is_____	"To solve this question, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Let's denote the events:
A: The first child is a girl
B: The second child is a girl

We are given that at least one of them was a girl. This means we have two possibilities:
1. The first child is a girl and the second child is also a girl (event A ∩ B)
2. The first child is a boy and the second child is a girl (complement of event A)

Now, let's calculate the probability of event A ∩ B occurring:
P(A) = Probability that the first child is a girl = 1/2
P(B|A) = Probability that the second child is a girl given that the first child is already known to be a girl = 1/2

Therefore, P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B|A) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4

The total probability when at least one of them was a girl can be calculated as follows:
Total probability = Event A ∪ Event B
Event A: Both children are girls (A ∩ B)
Event B: One boy and one girl (complement"
During a particular year in city X, there were an average (arithmetic mean) of 16,000 car accidents per day on weekends and an average of 40,000 per day on each of the other days of the week. Which of the following is nearest to the total number of accidents last year?	"To find the total number of car accidents in city X last year, we first need to calculate the average number of accidents per day for the entire week.

On weekends (2 days): 16,000 accidents/day * 2 days = 32,000 accidents
On weekdays (5 days): 40,000 accidents/day * 5 days = 200,000 accidents

Total number of accidents per week: 32,000 + 200,000 = 232,000 accidents

In a year with approximately 52 weeks:
Total number of accidents last year: 232,000 * 52 ≈12.064 million

A man earns RS. 20 on the first day and spends Rs. 15 on the next day. He again earns Rs. 20 on the third day and spends Rs. 15 on the fourth day. If he continues to save like this, how soon will he have Rs. 60 in hand?	"To find out how soon the man will have Rs. 60 in hand, let's analyze his earnings and spendings:

On each cycle of 4 days:
- Earnings = Rs. 20 + Rs. 20 = Rs. 40
- Spendings = Rs. 15 + Rs. 15 = Rs. 30
- Savings per cycle = Earnings - Spendings = Rs. 40 - Rs. 30 = Rs. 10

So, the man saves Rs. 10 every cycle of four days.

Now, we need to determine how many cycles are needed to reach a total savings of at least Rs. 60:

Total savings required = Rs. 60

Number of cycles needed = Total savings required / Savings per cycle
Number of cycles needed = Rs.60 /Rs .10=6 cycles 

Since each cycle is for four days, the total number of days required would be:
Total number of days= Number of cycles * Days per cycle 
Total number of days=6*4=24

Therefore, he will have RS .60 on the ""24th day"".

Money is paid into an account in portions of $500 and paid out in portions of $300. If after a month the account grew by $1,200, what is the least possible number of transactions that could have been made?	"Let's denote the number of $500 portions paid into the account as 'x' and the number of $300 portions paid out of the account as 'y'.

Given that after a month, the account grew by $1,200, we can set up an equation based on the transactions:
$500x - $300y = $1,200

To find the least possible number of transactions made, we need to minimize both x and y. Since each transaction involves either paying in $500 or paying out $300, we want to minimize these values.

Let's start with some assumptions:
- If all transactions were payments in ($500), then 3 transactions would result in an increase of only $1,500.
- If all transactions were payments out ($300), then 4 transactions would result in a decrease of only $1,200.

Since we need an increase of exactly $1,200 and considering these assumptions above, it is not possible to achieve this with fewer than 4 transactions. 

Therefore,
Rationale: The least possible number of transactions that could have been made is 4.

- Increase in price per share = Rs 0.25
- Total increase for x shares = Rs 12.50

Let's denote the number of shares purchased as x.

To find the number of shares purchased, we can set up an equation based on the given information:
0.25 * x = 12.50

Now, solve for x:
x = 12.50 / 0.25
x = 50

Therefore, the investor had purchased 50 shares of stock.

A is 30% more efficient than B. How much time will they, working together, take to complete a job which A along could have done in 23 days?	"Let's first find out the ratio of efficiency between A and B.

If A is 30% more efficient than B, then A's efficiency is 100% + 30% = 130% of B's efficiency.

This can be written as:
A's efficiency / B's efficiency = 130% / 100% = 1.3

Now, let's assume that B takes x days to complete the job alone. So, in one day, B completes 1/x of the job.

Since A is 30% more efficient than B, A will complete the same job in (x * (100/130)) days because it is only at a rate of \( \frac{100}{130} \) times that of A.

Now, if we consider both working together:
Combined work done by A and B in one day = \( \frac{1}{23} + \frac{1}{\left(\frac{x*100}{130}\right)} \)

We know that they together take 'n' days to finish the job. Therefore,
\( n * (\frac{1}{23} + \frac{1}{\left(\frac{x*100}{130}\right)}) = 1 \)

The marked price of a clock is Rs.6400. It is to be sold at Rs.4896 at two successive discounts. If the first discount is 10%, the second discount is	"Given:
Marked price of the clock = Rs. 6400
Selling price after two successive discounts = Rs. 4896
First discount = 10%

Let the second discount be x%.

After the first discount of 10%, the price becomes:
90% of Rs. 6400 = (90/100) * 6400 = Rs. 5760

Now, after the second discount of x%, the selling price is Rs. 4896.

So, (100 - x)% of Rs. 5760 = Rs. 4896

Calculating this:
(100 - x)/100 * 5760 = 4896
5760 - (57.60x) = 4896
57.60x = 864
x ≈14.29%

Therefore, the second discount is approximately equal to a reduction of about 14%.

A dog takes 4 leaps for every 5 leaps of a hare but 3 leaps of a dog are equal to 4 leaps of the hare. Compare their speeds.	"To compare the speeds of the dog and the hare, we can use the given ratios of their leaps.

Let's assume:
- The dog takes 4 leaps for every 5 leaps of the hare.
- 3 leaps of the dog are equal to 4 leaps of the hare.

Let's find a common ratio for both animals' speeds:

For the dog:
Let x be the number of leaps taken by the hare. Then, for every 5 leaps taken by the hare, the dog takes 4 * (5/5) = 4 leaps.
So, in terms of x, we have: Dog's speed = 4x / (5x) = 4/5

For the hare:
Given that 3 leaps of a dog are equal to 4 leaps of a hare:
3 * Dog's speed = 4 * Hare's speed
3 * (4/5) = 4 * Hare's speed
Hare's speed = (3*4)/(5*4) = 3/5

Therefore, comparing their speeds gives us:
Dog's speed : Hare's speed
= (Dog's leap ratio) : (Hare's leap ratio)

If the ratio of the ages of Maya and Chhaya is 6:5 at present, and fifteen years from now, the ratio will get changed to 9:8, then find Maya's present age.	"To solve this question, we can use the concept of ratios and ages.

Let's assume the present age of Maya is 6x years and the present age of Chhaya is 5x years.

Fifteen years from now, Maya's age will be 6x + 15 and Chhaya's age will be 5x + 15.

According to the given information, the ratio of their ages fifteen years from now is 9:8. So we can set up an equation:

(6x + 15) / (5x + 15) = 9 / 8

Scott bought three bags of candy with 75 pieces in each one. He plans to divide all the candy evenly among seven friends. How many pieces of candy will Scott have left for himself?	"To find out how many pieces of candy Scott will have left for himself, we first need to calculate the total number of candies he has and then divide them evenly among his seven friends.

Given:
- Number of bags of candy = 3
- Pieces of candy in each bag = 75
- Total friends to share with = 7

Total pieces of candy Scott has = 3 bags * 75 pieces per bag = 225 pieces

Now, we need to divide these candies equally among the seven friends:
225 pieces / 7 friends ≈ 32.14 pieces per friend

Since candies cannot be divided into fractions, Scott will give away a total of (7 friends * 32) = 224 pieces to his friends.

To find out how many candies Scott will have left for himself:
225 total candies - 224 given to friends = **1 piece**

Therefore, Scott will have **1 piece** of candy left for himself.

"Two trains under a controlled experiment begin at a speed of 100 mph in the opposite direction in a tunnel. A supersonic bee is left in the tunnel which can fly at a speed of 1000 mph. The tunnel is 200 miles long. When the trains start running on a constant speed of 100 mph, the supersonic bee starts flying from one train towards the other. As soon as the bee reaches the second train, it starts flying back towards the first train.
If the bee keeps flying to and fro in the tunnel till the trains collide, how much distance will it have covered in total?"	"Rationale: 
Let's first calculate the time it takes for the trains to collide in the tunnel. Since they are moving towards each other at a combined speed of 100 mph + 100 mph = 200 mph, and the tunnel is 200 miles long, they will collide in 200 miles / 200 mph = 1 hour.

During this time, the bee will be flying back and forth between the trains at a speed of 1000 mph. So, in one hour, it covers a distance of 1000 miles.

Since it keeps flying back and forth until the trains collide, it will cover this distance multiple times. Therefore, the total distance covered by the bee is:
Total distance = Distance covered in one trip * Number of trips
Total distance = 1000 miles * Number of trips

As we know that each round trip takes one hour and that's when trains collide after an hour,
Number of trips = Total time taken (in hours) before collision

Therefore,
Total distance = 1000 miles * Total time taken (in hours)

Answer: E)5000 miles."
6 pigs cost the same as 9 sheep. 27 sheep cost the same as 30 goats. 50 goats cost the same as 3 elephants. If two elephants cost $4800, then the cost of one pig in dollar is	"Given:
6 pigs cost the same as 9 sheep
27 sheep cost the same as 30 goats
50 goats cost the same as 3 elephants
Two elephants cost $4800

Let's find the cost of one elephant first:
Since two elephants cost $4800, then one elephant costs $4800 / 2 = $2400.

Now, let's find the cost of one goat:
From ""50 goats cost the same as 3 elephants"", we know that 50 goats = 3 elephants.
So, 1 goat = (3/50) * 1 elephant = (3/50) * $2400 = $144.

Next, let's find the cost of one sheep:
From ""27 sheep cost the same as 30 goats"", we know that 27 sheep = 30 goats.
So, 1 sheep = (30/27) * 1 goat = (10/9) * $144 ≈ $160.

Finally, let's find the cost of one pig:
From ""6 pigs cost the same as 9 sheep"", we know that 6 pigs = 9 sheep.
So, 1 pig = (9/6) * price of one sheep ≈ (9/6) *"
A certain prosthodontist specializes in implanting gold and silver teeth in his patients’ mouths. He charges $650 for a gold tooth and $325 for a silver tooth. If his total fees for implanting gold and silver teeth last week were $15,925 in total, and he implanted five more gold teeth than silver teeth, how many teeth in total did he implant over the week?	"Given:
- Cost of a gold tooth = $650
- Cost of a silver tooth = $325
- Total fees for implanting gold and silver teeth last week = $15,925
- Number of gold teeth implanted = Number of silver teeth + 5

Let:
- Number of silver teeth implanted = x
- Number of gold teeth implanted = x + 5

Total fees can be expressed as:
$650 * (x + 5) + $325 * x = $15,925

Solving the equation:
$650x + $325 * 5 + $325x = $15,925
$975x + $1625 = $15,925
$975x = $14,300
x ≈ 14.67

Since we cannot have a fraction of a tooth, we round down to the nearest whole number.

Number of silver teeth implanted (x) ≈ 14
Number of gold teeth implanted (x + 5) ≈ 19

Total number of teeth implanted over the week:
14 (silver) + 19 (gold) ≈ 33

30% of all Huhulians own at least one TV. 24% of Huhulians who own at least one TV own at least four TV's. What percent of Huhulians own at least four TV's?	"To find the percentage of Huhulians who own at least four TVs, we can use the given information:

Let's assume there are 100 Huhulians for easier calculation.

From the first statement, 30% of all Huhulians own at least one TV. So, 30 out of 100 Huhulians own at least one TV.

Then from the second statement, 24% of those who own at least one TV own at least four TVs. 
So, out of those 30 who own at least one TV, 24% or (24/100)*30 = 7.2 people own at least four TVs.

Therefore, the percentage of Huhulians who own at least four TVs is 7.2%.

If a man reduces the selling price of a fan from Rs.400 to Rs.380, his loss increases by 2%. The cost price of the fan is	"Given:
Initial selling price = Rs. 400
New selling price = Rs. 380
Increase in loss = 2%

Let the cost price of the fan be Rs. x.

Initially, the loss was (400 - x) and after reducing the selling price to Rs. 380, the new loss is (380 - x).

According to the given information, there is a 2% increase in loss:
(380 - x) = (1 + 0.02)(400 - x)
Solving this equation will give us the value of x, which is the cost price of the fan.

Expanding and solving for x:
380 - x = 1.02 * 400 - 1.02x
380 - x = 408 - 1.02x
0.02x = 28
x = Rs.1400

Therefore, the cost price of the fan is Rs.1400.

A small business invests $9,800 in equipment to produce a product. Each unit of the product costs $0.65 to produce and is sold for $1.20. How many units of the product must be sold before the revenue received equals the total expense of production, including the initial investment in equipment?	"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Calculate the profit per unit:
   - Profit per unit = Selling price per unit - Cost to produce per unit
   - Profit per unit = $1.20 - $0.65
   - Profit per unit = $0.55

2. Calculate the total expense of production, including the initial investment:
   - Total expense = Initial investment + (Cost to produce one unit * Number of units)
   - Total expense = $9,800 + ($0.65 * x), where x is the number of units

3. Calculate the revenue received when selling x units:
   - Revenue received = Selling price per unit * Number of units sold
   - Revenue received = $1.20 * x

4. Set up an equation to find the break-even point when revenue equals total expenses:
   Revenue received = Total expense
   $1.20x = $9,800 + ($0.65x)

5. Solve for x (number of units):
   $1.20x = $9,800 + ($0.65x)
   0.55x = 9800
   x ≈ 17818

Rationale: To find how many units"

A tailor had a number of shirt pieces to cut from a roll of fabric. He cut each roll of equal length into 12 pieces. He cut at the rate of 40 cuts a minute. How many rolls would be cut in 30 minutes ?	"Let's calculate the number of cuts the tailor makes in 30 minutes first.

Number of cuts in 1 minute = 40
Number of cuts in 30 minutes = 40 * 30 = 1200

Since each roll is cut into 12 pieces, the number of rolls cut will be:
Number of rolls cut = Total cuts / Cuts per roll = 1200 / 12 = 100

Therefore, in 30 minutes, the tailor would have cut through approximately **100 rolls**.

3 men and 3 women need to be seated in 2 rows with 3 chairs in each row. All men have to be seated in the back row. How many ways can this be done?	"To solve this problem, we can first seat the men in the back row since they have to be seated there. Then, we can arrange the women in the front row.

1. Seating the men:
Since all 3 men need to be seated in the back row, there is only one way to arrange them.

2. Seating the women:
Now, we have 3 women left to be seated in a row of 3 chairs. We can calculate this using permutations.
There are 3 women and 3 chairs in the front row, so we need to find how many ways these 3 women can be arranged in these 3 chairs.
This is given by \( ^{3}P_{3} = \frac{3!}{(3-3)!} = \frac{6}{0!} = 6 \) ways.

Therefore, the total number of ways that this seating arrangement can be done is \(1 (men) * 6 (women) = 6\) ways.

If a number is chosen at random from the set {1, 2, 3, ...., 100}, then the probability that the chosen number is a perfect cube is?	"To find the probability that a randomly chosen number from the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 100} is a perfect cube, we first need to determine how many perfect cubes are there in this set.

The perfect cubes less than or equal to 100 are: 1^3 = 1, 2^3 = 8, 3^3 = 27, and so on until (4)^3 =64. So there are a total of four perfect cubes in the set {1, 2, ...,100}.

Since there are a total of \(100\) numbers in the set and only \(4\) of them are perfect cubes, the probability of choosing a perfect cube is given by:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} \]

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{4}{100} \]

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{1}{25} \]

Therefore, the probability that the chosen number is a perfect cube is \( \frac{1}{25} \).

A train running between two stations A and B arrives at its destination 10 minutes late when its speed is 50 km/h and 50 minutes late when its speed is 30 km/h. What is the distance between the stations A and B ?	"Given:
Let the distance between stations A and B be x km.
Let the actual time taken by the train to travel this distance at 50 km/h be t hours.

According to the given information:
At 50 km/h, it arrives 10 minutes late, so the time taken = t + (10/60) hours.
At 30 km/h, it arrives 50 minutes late, so the time taken = t + (50/60) hours.

Using the formula: Speed = Distance / Time

For speed of 50 km/h:
\(x = 50 * (t + \frac{1}{6})\) 

For speed of 30 km/h:
\(x = 30 * (t + \frac{5}{6})\)

Now equate both expressions for x:

\(50 * (t + \frac{1}{6}) = 30 * (t + \frac{5}{6})\)

Solving for t:

\(50t + \frac{50}{6} = 30t + \frac{150}{6}\)

\(20t = \frac{100}{6}\)

\(t = \frac{5}{3}\) hours

Substitute back to find x:

The H.C.F and L.C.M. of two numbers are 50 and 100 respectively. If the first number is divided by 2, the quotient is 50, the second number is:	"Given:
H.C.F = 50
L.C.M. = 100
Quotient when the first number is divided by 2 = 50

Let the two numbers be a and b.

We know that product of two numbers = H.C.F * L.C.M.
So, a * b = 50 * 100
a * b = 5000   (1)

Also, we are given that when the first number is divided by 2, the quotient is 50.
This means a/2 = 50
a = 100   (2)

Bert and Ernie are among 12 tenants on Sesame Street, from which 9 tenants are to be selected for the neighborhood watch. Of the different possible selections, how many contain neither Bert nor Ernie?	"To solve this problem, we first need to find the number of ways to select 9 tenants from the remaining 10 tenants excluding Bert and Ernie. This can be calculated using combinations.

Let's denote Bert and Ernie as special cases, so they cannot be selected. We have a total of 12 - 2 = 10 tenants to choose from.

The number of ways to select 9 tenants out of these 10 is given by C(10, 9) which is calculated as:
C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)

C(10, 9) = 10! / (9!(10-9)!)
C(10, 9) = (10 * 9!) / (9! *1)
C(10, 9) = 10

Therefore, there are a total of 10 ways to select a group of nine tenants that do not include Bert or Ernie.

There are N numbers of gold biscuits in the house, in which four people are lived. If the first men woke up and divided the biscuits into 5 equal piles and found one extra biscuit. He took one of those piles along with the extra biscuit and hid them. He then gathered the 4 remaining piles into a big pile, woke up the second person and went to sleep. Each of the other 3 persons did the same one by one i.e. divided the big pile into 5 equal piles and found one extra biscuit. Each hid one of the piles along with the extra biscuit and gathered the remaining 4 piles into a big pile. If N>1000, what could be the least value of N?	"Rationale: Let's work backwards to find the least value of N. 

1. After the fourth person, there are 5 piles left, each with one extra biscuit.
2. Before the fourth person hid a pile, there were 25 piles (5 piles from the third person * 5).
3. Before the third person hid a pile, there were 125 piles (25 piles from the second person * 5).
4. Before the second person hid a pile, there were 625 piles (125 piles from the first person * 5).

The average age of the first seven people to arrive at Nikhil’s birthday is 21. When Vijay (29) arrived, the mean age is increased to 22. Marry (also 29) arrived next. The tenth and last person to arrive at Nikhil's party is Nikhil himself, and the mean age increased to 30 years. How old is Nikhil on his birthday?	"Let's break down the information given in the question step by step:

1. The average age of the first seven people is 21.
2. When Vijay (29) arrives, the mean age becomes 22.
3. Marry (also 29) arrives next.
4. Nikhil is the tenth and last person to arrive, and then the mean age becomes 30.

Now let's calculate Nikhil's age:

Step 1: Initially, for the first seven people:
Total age = 7 * 21 = 147

Step 2: When Vijay arrives:
Total age = Total previous age + Vijay's age = 147 + 29 = 176
Number of people now = 8

Step 3: After Marry arrives:
Total age = Total previous age + Marry's age =176 +29=205
Number of people now=9

Step4: When Nikhil arrives:
Let Nikhil's Age be N
Total Age=(205+N)
Number of People=10
Given Average=(205+N)/10=30
Solving this equation gives N=95

Therefore, Nikhil is **95 years old** on his birthday.

Marla starts running around a circular track at the same time Nick starts walking around the same circular track. Marla completes 32 laps around the track per hour and Nick completes 12 laps around the track per hour. How many minutes after Marla and Nick begin moving will Marla have completed 5 more laps around the track than Nick?	"Let's first find the difference in the number of laps Marla and Nick complete per hour:
Marla completes 32 laps per hour and Nick completes 12 laps per hour.
So, Marla completes 32 - 12 = 20 more laps than Nick in one hour.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for Marla to complete 5 more laps than Nick:
Since Marla completes 20 more laps than Nick in one hour, she needs (5/20) * 60 minutes to complete 5 more laps than Nick.
This simplifies to (1/4) * 60 = 15 minutes.

Therefore, after moving for 15 minutes, Marla will have completed exactly 5 more laps around the track than Nick.

Proportion of Yuvaraj’s age to Ganguly’s age is 4:3. Yuvaraj will be 26 years old after 6 years. What is the age of Ganguly now?	"Given:
- The proportion of Yuvaraj’s age to Ganguly’s age is 4:3.
- Yuvaraj will be 26 years old after 6 years.

Let's denote the current ages of Yuvaraj and Ganguly as \(4x\) and \(3x\) respectively, where \(x\) is a positive integer representing the common factor in their ages based on the given proportion.

After 6 years, Yuvaraj's age will be \(4x + 6 = 26\).
Solving for \(x\):
\(4x + 6 = 26\)
\(4x = 20\)
\(x = \frac{20}{4}\)
\(x = 5\)

Now we can find the current age of Ganguly:
Ganguly's current age = \(3 \times x\)
Ganguly's current age = \(3 \times 5\)
Ganguly's current age = 15

Therefore, the current age of Ganguly is 15 years.

A man says that he gained 10 percent as profit in selling a suitable cloth material. He says if he had purchased the same one 10 percent cheaper than it was actual and if he had sold it for 20% profit he gets 25paise less. find at what price he sold the suit?	"Let's denote the original cost price of the cloth material as $x.

Given that the man gained a 10% profit when he sold it at the original price, his selling price would be \(1.10x\).

If he had purchased it 10% cheaper than its actual price, his new cost price would be \(0.90x\). And if he had sold it for a 20% profit at this new cost price, his selling price would be \(1.20*0.90x = 1.08x\).

According to the problem, selling at this new lower purchase and higher selling prices results in him getting 25 paise less compared to his initial sale:
\[1.10x - (1.08x + 0.25) = 0 \]
\[1.10x - 1.08x - 0.25 = 0 \]
\[0.02x = 0.25 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.25}{0.02} \]
\[ x =12 .5\]

Therefore, the original cost price of the cloth material was Rs12 .5.
The selling price is given by \(1 .10 *12 .5=13 .75"
Tanya's grandfather was 8 times older to her 16 years ago. He would be 3 times of her age 8 years from now. What was ratio of ages of Tanya and her grandfather 8 years ago.	"Let's denote Tanya's current age as T and her grandfather's current age as G.

From the given information:
1. 16 years ago, Tanya's grandfather was 8 times older than Tanya:
G - 16 = 8(T - 16)

2. In 8 years from now, Tanya's grandfather will be 3 times of her age:
G + 8 = 3(T + 8)

Now, we can solve these two equations to find the current ages of Tanya and her grandfather.

Expanding the first equation:
G - 16 = 8T -128
G = 8T -112

Substitute G in the second equation:
8T -112 + 8 =3T +24
5T=96
T=19.2

Now, substitute back to find G:
G= (8*19.2) -112
G=153.6-112
G=41.6

Therefore, the ratio of ages of Tanya and her grandfather is:

(41.6-16)/(19.2-16) =25.6/3.2 =32/4 =11/1

So, the ratio of ages of Tanya and her"
The least possible value of |89 - 9a|, where a is an integer, is	"Given the expression |89 - 9a|, we want to find the least possible value when a is an integer.

To minimize this expression, we need to consider two cases:
1. When 89 - 9a is positive: In this case, we want to make 9a as large as possible while keeping it less than or equal to 89.
2. When 89 - 9a is negative: In this case, we want to make 9a as small as possible while still being greater than or equal to 89.

Let's analyze these cases:

1. When 89 - 9a is positive:
   The largest multiple of 9 less than or equal to 89 is when a = 10 (since \(10 \times 9 =90 >89\)).

- The player who did not serve won 5 games.

Since there are a total of 9 games played (6 + 3 = 9), and the player who did not serve won 5 out of these, it implies that this player must have served first. This is because if Rafa had served first, he would have served in all even-numbered games (2nd, 4th, etc.), but since he only won three odd-numbered games (1st, 3rd, etc.), it means he didn't serve first.

Ashish is given Rs. 158 in one-rupee denominations. He has been asked to allocate them into a number of bags such that any amount required between Re 1 and Rs. 158 can be given by handing out a certain number of bags without opening them. What is the minimum number of bags required?	"To find the minimum number of bags required, we need to consider the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 158. This is because any amount between Re 1 and Rs. 158 can be represented using a combination of powers of 2.

In this case, the highest power of 2 less than or equal to 158 is \(2^7 = 128\). We will need bags representing each power of 2 from \(2^0\) up to \(2^7\).

So, the minimum number of bags required would be the sum of all these powers: 
\(1 + 2 + 4 + ... +128 = (2^{8} -1) = (256-1) =255\)

Therefore, Ashish needs a minimum of \(\boxed{255}\) bags to ensure any amount between Re 1 and Rs.158 can be given without opening them.

Which of the following is the equation of a line that goes through the point (10,5) and has an x-intercept of 5.	"To find the equation of a line that goes through the point (10,5) and has an x-intercept of 5, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation: y - y1 = m(x - x1), where (x1, y1) is the given point and m is the slope of the line.

Given:
Point (x1, y1) = (10, 5)
X-intercept = 5

Since the line passes through the x-intercept at (5,0), we can use this point to find the slope:

Slope (m) = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
Slope = (0 - 5) / (5 - 10)
Slope = (-5) / (-5)
Slope = 1

Now that we have found the slope as 1 and a point on the line as (10, 5), we can substitute these values into the point-slope form:

y - 5 = 1(x - 10)

Simplifying further:

y - 5 = x - 10
y = x - 10 + 5
y = x - 4

The least perfect square number, exactly divisible by 21, 36 and 56 is?	"To find the least perfect square number that is exactly divisible by 21, 36, and 56, we need to find the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of these numbers first.

Step 1: Find LCM of 21, 36, and 56:
Prime factorization of each number:
- \(21 = 3 * 7\)
- \(36 = 2^2 * 3^2\)

Mr. X died when his age was 1/59th of year of birth. What was his date of birth?	"To find Mr. X's date of birth, we need to calculate his age at the time of his death when it was 1/59th of his year of birth.

Let's denote Mr. X's age at the time of death as A and his year of birth as B.

Given that A = 1/59 * B

We also know that he died, so let's denote the year he died as D.

Therefore, D - B = A

Substitute the value of A from the first equation into this equation:

D - B = 1/59 * B

Now, we can solve for B:

58/59 * B = D
B = 59/58 * D

Santa distributes 2 gifts to every child in the street at the Christmas evening. He mistakenly gives 4 gifts to some children. If he distributed 50 gifts to 21 children. How many children got 4 gifts?	"Let's denote the number of children who received 2 gifts as x and the number of children who received 4 gifts as y.

From the given information:
1. Santa distributes 2 gifts to every child in the street, so the total number of 2-gifts distributed is 2x.
2. Santa mistakenly gives 4 gifts to some children, so the total number of 4-gifts distributed is 4y.
3. The total number of gifts distributed is equal to 50.

We are also given that:
- The total number of children who received gifts is 21.

So we can write two equations based on this information:
1. x + y = 21 (Total number of children)
2. 2x + 4y = 50 (Total number of gifts)

The ratio of A’s and B’s salary is 9 : 4. If A’s salary is increased by 15%, then his total salary becomes 5175. What is the salary of B?	"Given:
- The ratio of A's and B's salary is 9:4.
- A's salary is increased by 15%, making his total salary $5175.

Let the original salaries of A and B be 9x and 4x respectively.

After a 15% increase in A's salary, the new salary becomes:
9x + 0.15(9x) = $5175
Solving for x:
9x + 1.35x = $5175
10.35x = $5175

1. 4 times the smaller one is less than 3 times the larger one by 5:
\( 4x = 3y - 5 \)

2. The sum of the numbers is larger than 6 times their difference by 6:
\( x + y > 6(y - x) + 6 \)

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \).

From equation (1):
\( 4x = 3y - 5 \\
\Rightarrow y = \frac{4x + 5}{3} \)

Substitute this expression for \( y \) into equation (2):
\( x + \frac{4x + 5}{3} > 6(\frac{4x+5}{3} - x) +6 \\
\Rightarrow x + \frac{4x+5}{3} >8-\frac{2}{3} \\
\Rightarrow (3x+4x+5)/3 >22/3 \\

Cost of 3 cricket balls = cost of 2 pairs of leg pads. Cost of 3 pairs of leg pads = cost of 2 pairs of gloves. Cost of 3 pairs of gloves = cost of 2 cricket bats. If a cricket bat costs Rs 54, what is the cost of a cricket ball?	"Given:
Cost of 3 cricket balls = cost of 2 pairs of leg pads
Cost of 3 pairs of leg pads = cost of 2 pairs of gloves
Cost of 3 pairs of gloves = cost of 2 cricket bats

Let's find the relation between the cost of a cricket ball and a cricket bat:
1. Cost of a cricket bat = Rs 54
2. Cost ratio: 
   - Cricket ball : Leg pads : Gloves : Cricket bat = (1/3) : (1/2) : (1/3) : (1/2)
   - Simplifying, we get: Cricket ball : Cricket bat = (1/9) * Rs 54 : Rs 54
   - Therefore, Cost ratio is: Cricket ball : Cricket bat = Rs 6 : Rs 54

Now, let's find the cost of a cricket ball:
- Since the cost ratio is in terms relative to the price given for the cricket bat,
- The cost for a cricket ball would be one-ninth that price.
- So, Cost for a cricket ball = (1/9) * Rs 54
- Calculating this gives us: Cost for a cricket ball = Rs 6

John invested $100 in each of the funds A and B. After one year, the value of the money in fund A was $10 higher than the value of the money in fund B. After another year, the value of the money in fund A was $25 higher than the value of the money in fund B. If the value of the money in each fund increased by a fixed interest compounded annually, what was the annual interest of fund A?	"Let's denote the annual interest rate for Fund A as \( r \) and for Fund B as \( s \).

After one year:
- Value of money in Fund A = $100 + $100 * \( r \) = $100(1 + r)
- Value of money in Fund B = $100 + $100 * \( s \) = $100(1 + s)

Given that the value of money in Fund A was $10 higher than the value of money in Fund B after one year, we have:
$100(1 + r) = $100(1 + s) + 10
\( 1 + r = 1 + s + 0.10 \)
\( r - s = 0.10 \)   (Equation 1)

After another year:
- Value of money in Fund A = $100(1+r)(1+r) = $100(1+r)^2
- Value of money in Fund B = $100(1+s)(1+s) =$100(1+s)^2

Given that the value of money in Fund A was now $25 higher than the value of money in Fund B, we have:

If P represents a single digit in the four digit number x=18P6, how many different values of P are there such that x is divisible by 8?	"To find the values of P such that the number x=18P6 is divisible by 8, we need to check the divisibility rule for 8. A number is divisible by 8 if the number formed by its last three digits is divisible by 8.

Given x=18P6, we are interested in the number formed by P6.

Let's list down possible values of P and check if each corresponding number is divisible by 8:
1. If P = 0, then the number becomes 186 which is not divisible by 8.
2. If P = 1, then the number becomes 181 which is not divisible by 8.
3. If P = 2, then the number becomes 182 which is divisible by 8.
4. If P = ... (continue checking until all single-digit values of P have been considered)

Vegetables contains 68% water and green vegetables contains 20% water. How much green vegetables can be obtained from 100 kg of Vegetables ?	"To find out how much green vegetables can be obtained from 100 kg of vegetables, we need to consider the water content in both types of vegetables.

Let's assume x kg of green vegetables can be obtained from 100 kg of vegetables.

Given that the total weight of the vegetable is 100 kg and it contains 68% water:
- The weight of actual vegetable matter in 100 kg = 100 - (68% of 100) = 32 kg

Since green vegetables contain only 20% water, the weight of actual vegetable matter in x kg of green vegetables would be:
- Weight of actual vegetable matter in x kg = x - (20% of x) = 0.8x

As per our assumption, this should equal the weight of actual vegetable matter in the original mix:
- Weight of actual vegetable matter in x kg = Weight of actual vegetable matter in original mix
- Therefore, we have: 
0.8x = 32
x = 32 / 0.8
x = 40

Therefore, from every 100 kg mix containing both types, we can obtain only \(40\) kgs worth as pure green veggies.

So, Answer: E) \(40\)"
M is a set of even numbers from 1 to 23 and odd numbers from 24 to 100. Find no. of zeroes in the sum of all values in the set.	"To find the sum of all values in set M, we need to calculate the sum of even numbers from 1 to 23 and odd numbers from 24 to 100 separately and then add them together.

For even numbers from 1 to 23:
The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: Sum = n/2 * (first term + last term), where n is the number of terms.
In this case, there are 12 even numbers from 2 to 22. So, n = 12.
The first term is 2 and the last term is 22.
Sum = 12/2 * (2 + 22) = 6 * (24) =144

For odd numbers from 24 to100:
Similarly, there are (100-24)/2 +1=39 odd numbers between these ranges.
First term=25 and Last Term=99
Sum =39/2 *(25+99)=19*124=2356

Total sum=sum of even+sum of odd=144+2356=2500

Now, we need to find how many zeroes are in the number '2500'.

During a 10-week period, a doughnut store conducted a promotion by giving away one free doughnut with every doughnut purchased. If the store sold and gave away a total of K doughnuts per week, and each doughnut was sold for $0.25, how many dollars worth of doughnuts did the store give away?	"To find out how many dollars worth of doughnuts the store gave away during the promotion, we need to calculate the total value of the free doughnuts given with every purchase.

Given:
- Each doughnut was sold for $0.25.
- One free doughnut was given with every doughnut purchased.

Let's break down the calculation step by step:

1. For each pair of a purchased doughnut and a free doughnut, the total cost is $0.25 (for one purchased) + $0.25 (for one free) = $0.50.

2. Since one free doughnut was given with every purchased one, there were 2 doughnuts in each pair valued at $0.50.

3. The total value of K pairs of these 2-doughnut sets would be K * $0.50 = $0.50K.

Therefore, during the 10-week period, the store gave away a total of $0.50K worth of doughnuts per week.

A batsman has scored an average of 46 runs for a certain number of innings played in England. When he came back to India, he played another two test matches of two innings each and scored at an average of 55 runs. For the innings in England and in India taken together, he has improved his average by 2 runs over the matches played in England. Find the number of innings played in England.	"Let the total number of innings played in England be x.

Total runs scored in England = 46x

Total runs scored in India = 55*4 (2 matches with 2 innings each)

Total runs scored overall = Total runs scored in England + Total runs scored in India

Average before playing in India = Total runs scored overall / (x + 4)

According to the given information, the average after playing in India is improved by 2 runs over the average before playing in India:

Average after playing in India = Average before playing in India + 2

Now we can set up an equation and solve for x:

(46x + 220) / (x + 4) = ((46x + 220) + (55*4)) / (x + 8)

Solving this equation will give us the value of x, which represents the number of innings played in England.

Rationale: By setting up and solving this equation, we can find out how many innings were played by the batsman while he was in England.

There was a simple interest of Rs. 4016.25 on a principal amount at the rate of 9% p.a. in 5 years. Find the principal amount.	"Given:
Simple interest (SI) = Rs. 4016.25
Rate of interest (R) = 9% per annum
Time (T) = 5 years

We know that the formula for calculating simple interest is:
SI = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100

Substitute the given values into the formula:
4016.25 = (Principal * 9 * 5) / 100

Simplify the equation to find the principal amount:
4016.25 = (45 * Principal) / 100
4016.25 * 100 = 45 * Principal
401625 = 45 * Principal
Principal = 401625 / 45

A fair coin is tossed 6 times. If heads appears on the first 2 tosses, then what is the total number of heads we would expect after all 6 tosses.	"To solve this problem, we need to understand that each coin toss is an independent event and the probability of getting a head on each toss is 0.5 for a fair coin.

Given that the first 2 tosses are heads, we already have 2 heads. Now, for the remaining 4 tosses:
- The probability of getting a head on each of these tosses is still 0.5.
- Therefore, the expected number of additional heads from these 4 tosses would be: 
   Expected additional heads = Probability(head) * Number of remaining tosses
                             = 0.5 * 4
                             = 2

Adding the initial 2 heads to the expected additional heads gives us:
Total expected number of heads after all 6 tosses = Initial heads + Expected additional heads
                                                  = 2 + 2
                                                  = 4

Therefore, we would expect a total of **4** heads after all 6 tosses.

A rectangle has twice the area of a square. The length of the rectangle is 14 cm greater than that side of the square whereas breadth is equal to side of the square. Find the perimeter of the square?	"Given:
Area of rectangle = 2 * Area of square
Let the side of the square be x cm.
So, area of square = x^2 sq. cm
Length of rectangle = x + 14 cm
Breadth of rectangle = x cm

Area of rectangle = Length * Breadth
2(x^2) = (x + 14) * x
2x^2 = x^2 + 14x
x^2 - 14x = 0
x(x - 14) = 0

Therefore, either x=0 or (x-14)=0, but since length and breadth cannot be zero,
we have: 
x - 14 = 0

For the two shipments combined, what percent of the machine parts were defective?	"Given examples show a clear step-by-step approach to solving math word problems. Let's apply the same methodology to solve the test question:

Question: In a shipment of 120 machine parts, 5 percent were defective. In a shipment of 80 machine parts, 10 percent were defective. For the two shipments combined, what percent of the machine parts were defective?

Let's calculate the number of defective parts in each shipment:
1. In the first shipment of 120 machine parts:
Defective parts = 5% of 120
Defective parts = (5/100) * 120
Defective parts = 6

John buys koolaid for 12$ at a local store. If he bought it at the wholesale store he would get an extra liter of koolaid for the same cost. Also, the koolaid is 1$ cheaper per liter at the wholesale store. What is the price per liter of the koolaid at the local store?	"Let's denote the price per liter of Koolaid at the local store as x dollars.

At the local store:
- John buys koolaid for $12, so he gets 12/x liters of Koolaid.

At the wholesale store:
- The cost is $12.
- The price per liter is $1 cheaper than at the local store, so it is (x - 1) dollars per liter.
- John would get an extra liter for the same cost, so he would get 13/(x - 1) liters of Koolaid.

Since both scenarios involve buying the same amount of Koolaid:
12/x = 13/(x - 1)

Solving this equation will give us the price per liter of Koolaid at the local store:

12(x - 1) = 13x
12x - 12 = 13x
-x = 12
x = -12

However, since x represents a price and cannot be negative, there seems to be an issue in setting up or solving this equation. Let's reevaluate our approach.

Box W and Box V each contain several blue sticks and red sticks, and all of the red sticks have the same length. The length of each red stick is 19 inches less that the average length of the sticks in Box W and 6 inches greater than the average length of the sticks in Box V. What is the average (arithmetic mean) length, in inches, of the sticks in Box W minus the average length, in inches, of the sticks in Box V?	"To find the average length of the sticks in Box W minus the average length of the sticks in Box V, we need to set up equations based on the given information.

Let:
- \( x \) be the average length of all sticks in Box W,
- \( y \) be the average length of all sticks in Box V,
- \( r \) be the length of each red stick.

From the information given:
1. The length of each red stick is 19 inches less than the average length of all sticks in Box W: 
\( r = x - 19 \)

2. The length of each red stick is 6 inches greater than the average length of all sticks in Box V: 
\( r = y + 6 \)

We can now solve these two equations simultaneously to find \( x \) and \( y \).

Substitute equation (1) into equation (2):
\( x - 19 = y + 6 \)
\( x = y + 25 \)

Now, we know that when they are equal, it means that their averages are equal too.
So, we have:
\[ x = y + 25\]

The difference between these averages will then be:

At the same moment, the gears start to rotate at the same rate in cm/s, with the larger gear moving clockwise and the smaller gear moving anticlockwise.
How far in centimeters will the notch on the larger gear have moved the second time the notches pass each other?"	"To find out how far the notch on the larger gear will have moved when they pass each other for the second time, we need to calculate the distance traveled by each gear in one complete rotation.

1. **Calculate Circumference of Each Gear:**
   - Circumference of a circle = π * diameter
   - For the larger gear with a diameter of 100 cm:
     Circumference = π * 100 cm = 100π cm
   - For the smaller gear with a diameter of 25 cm:
     Circumference = π * 25 cm = 25π cm

2. **Relative Speeds and Directions:**
   Since one gear is moving clockwise and the other anticlockwise, their relative speed is twice their individual speeds.
   
3. **Time Taken to Meet Again:**
   The notches will meet again after completing one full rotation each, which means both gears need to cover their respective circumferences once more.

Under a buy one get one free offer, with the selling price of a t-shirt of 4200. The shopkeeper says he got 33.33% profit. What is cost price ?	"To find the cost price of the t-shirt, we need to first calculate the profit percentage and then use it to find the cost price.

Given:
Selling price = $4200
Profit percentage = 33.33%

Let's calculate the profit amount first:
Profit% = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100
33.33% = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100
Profit = (33.33/100) * Cost Price

Since it is a buy one get one free offer, the selling price for two t-shirts would be $4200.
So, Selling price for one t-shirt = $4200 / 2 = $2100

Now, let's find the profit amount:
Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
(33.33/100) * Cost Price = $2100 - Cost Price

Solving for Cost Price:
(1/3) * Cost Price + Cost Price = $2100
4/3 * Cost Price = $2100
Cost Price = $2100 * 3 / 4
Cost Price = $1575

Discount amount on the first shirt = 15% of $20
= 0.15 * $20
= $3

Price of the first shirt after discount = Cost of one shirt - Discount amount
= $20 - $3
= $17

2. For the second shirt, there is an additional 10% discount on the reduced price from step 1:
Discount amount on the second shirt (after initial discount) = 10% of ($17)
= 0.10 * $17
= $1.70

Price of second shirt after both discounts = Price after initial discount - Additional discount amount
= $17 - $1.70
= $15.30

3. Total cost for two shirts:
Total cost = Price of first discounted shirt + Price of second discounted shirt
= ($17) + ($15.30)
= $32.30

Therefore, one would pay a total of"
John and Mike had equal amount of money in savings at the beginning of last year. Then, Mike’s savings increased by 20% by the end of last year and decreased by 20% this year. John’s savings at first decreased by 20% by the end of last year and then increased by 20% this year. What percentage of John’s and Mike’s savings combined are John’s savings alone?	"Let's assume that both John and Mike had $100 in savings at the beginning of last year.

At the end of last year:
- Mike's savings increased by 20%, so he had 120% of his initial savings: $100 * 1.2 = $120.
- John's savings decreased by 20%, so he had 80% of his initial savings: $100 * 0.8 = $80.

This year:
- Mike's savings decreased by 20%, so he has 80% of his previous year's savings: $120 * 0.8 = $96.
- John's savings increased by 20%, so he has 120% of his previous year's reduced amount: $80 * 1.2 = $96.

Now, to find what percentage of John’s and Mike’s combined total are John’s savings alone, we calculate:
John's Savings / (John's Savings + Mike's Savings) = ($96 / ($96 +$96)) *100%
= (48/192)*100%
= (1/4)*100%
=25%

Therefore, the answer is A)25%."
"A shopkeeper gives a full bottle of soft drink in return for five empty bottles. A guy has 77 empty bottles and he can use them to get full soft drink bottles.
How many filled bottles will he be able to collect?"	"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The shopkeeper exchanges 5 empty bottles for 1 full bottle.
2. The guy has a total of 77 empty bottles.

To find out how many filled bottles he can collect, we need to divide the total number of empty bottles by the exchange rate:

77 empty bottles / 5 = 15 full bottles

Therefore, the guy will be able to collect 15 filled bottles.

"A salesman enters the quantity sold and the price into the computer. Both the numbers are two-digit numbers. But, by mistake, both the numbers were entered with their digits interchanged. The total sales value remained the same, i.e. Rs. 1,148, but the inventory reduced by 54.
What is the actual price per piece?"	"Given:
Let the original quantity sold be represented as AB and the original price per piece be represented as CD.
After interchanging digits, the new quantity sold is BA and the new price per piece is DC.

According to the problem, we have:
(10A + B)(10C + D) = (10B + A)(10D + C)
This equation represents that the total sales value remains the same.

Also, it is given that inventory reduced by 54. This means:
(10A + B) - (10B + A) = 54
9A - 9B = 54
A - B = 6

Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously to find out the actual price per piece.

Let's start solving this step by step:

1. From A - B = 6, we know that A = B + 6.
2. Substitute this into our first equation: (10(B+6) + B)(10C + D) = (10B + (B+6))(10D+C)
3. Simplify this equation and solve for C in terms of B.
4. Use A - B = 6 to find both values of A and B.
5. Calculate CD using these"

The volume of a wall, 5 times as high as it is broad and 8 times as long as it is high, is 12.8 cubic meters. Find the breadth of the wall.	"Given:
- The volume of the wall is 12.8 cubic meters.
- The height is 5 times the breadth.
- The length is 8 times the height.

Let's denote:
- Height as H
- Breadth as B
- Length as L

From the given information, we have:
H = 5B   (1)
L = 8H   (2)

The volume of a rectangular solid is given by V = L * H * B. Substituting the values of L and H from equations (1) and (2) into this formula, we get:

V = (8H) * H * B
12.8 = 8H^2 * B
B = 12.8 / (8H^2)

Substitute H = 5B from equation (1) into the above equation to find B in terms of only one variable:

B = 12.8 / [8*(5B)^2]
B = 12.8 / [200*B^2]
200*B^3 = 12.8
B^3 = 0.064
B ≈ ∛0.064 ≈ ∛(64/1000) ≈ ∛("
A car travels at a speed of x kilometers per p hours. How many meters will it travel in s seconds, in terms of s, p and x. (xps ≠ 0; 1 kilometer = 1000 meters)?	"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Given:
- Speed of the car = x kilometers per p hours
- We need to find how many meters it will travel in s seconds

First, we need to convert the speed from kilometers per hour to meters per second since we are given time in seconds.
1 kilometer = 1000 meters and 1 hour = 3600 seconds.

So, the speed of the car in meters per second is:
x km/hr * (1000 m/1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) = x/3.6 m/s

Now, to find how many meters it will travel in s seconds, we use the formula: distance = speed * time
distance = (x/3.6) * s

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: A) sx/(3.6p)"
Anil invests an amount for 2 years at the rate of 15% per annum at simple interest.Had he invested in a scheme in which interest was compounded yearly he would have got Rs.450 more. Find the principal	"Let's denote the principal amount that Anil invested as P.

For simple interest:
Simple Interest (SI) = P * R * T
where R is the rate of interest and T is the time period.

Given that:
R = 15% per annum = 0.15
T = 2 years

So, for simple interest, Anil would have received:
SI_simple = P * 0.15 * 2

For compound interest compounded yearly:
Amount after 2 years with compound interest compounded yearly can be calculated using the formula:
A_compound = P(1 + R)^T

Given that he would have got Rs.450 more if he had invested in a scheme with compound interest, we can set up an equation:

P(1 + 0.15)^2 - P*0.15*2 = P*450
P(1.15)^2 - 0.3P = 450
1.3225P - 0.3P = 450
1.0225P = 450
P ≈ Rs.20,000

Therefore, the principal amount Anil invested was Rs.20,000.

Answer: C) Rs.20,000"
The ratio between the speeds of the A and B is 2:3, and therefore A takes 10 min more than the time taken by B to reach the destination. If A had walked at double the speed, he would have covered the distance in	"Given:
Speed ratio of A to B = 2:3
Time difference between A and B = 10 minutes

Let's assume the speed of A is 2x and the speed of B is 3x. 
According to the given information, time taken by A = time taken by B + 10 minutes.

Distance = Speed * Time

For A: Distance = (2x) * t, where t is the time taken by B.
For B: Distance = (3x) * (t - 10), as A takes 10 minutes more than B.

Since both cover the same distance:
(2x) * t = (3x) * (t - 10)
2xt = 3xt - 30x
xt = 30x

Now, if A had walked at double the speed:
New speed of A = 4x
New time taken by A to cover the distance would be t/2.

Therefore, Answer: E)19 min"

1 mark = $1 / 0.497 ≈ $2.01

Now, we can find the value of 150 marks:
150 marks = 150 * $2.01 ≈ $301.50

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the value of 150 marks is approximately $302.

Therefore, Answer: D) $302"
In a fuel station the service costs $2 per car, every liter of fuel costs $1. Assuming that a company owns 50 cars and that every fuel tank contains 80 liters and they are all empty, how much money total will it cost to fuel all cars?	"To calculate the total cost to fuel all 50 cars owned by the company, we need to consider both the service cost per car and the cost of fuel for each car.

Given:
- Service cost per car = $2
- Cost of one liter of fuel = $1
- Each car has a fuel tank capacity of 80 liters

First, let's find out the total cost for servicing all 50 cars:
Total service cost for 50 cars = $2 * 50 = $100

Next, let's calculate the total amount of fuel needed for all 50 cars:
Total liters of fuel needed for one car = 80 liters
Total liters of fuel needed for 50 cars = 80 liters/car * 50 cars = 4000 liters

Now, let's find out the total cost of purchasing this amount of fuel:
Total cost of purchasing all required fuel = $1/liter * 4000 liters = $4000

Finally, we add up the service costs and the fuel costs to get the total amount it will cost to fill up all cars:
Total cost = Total service cost + Total fuel cost
Total cost = $100 + $4000
Total cost = $4100

Therefore, it will total to '$"
A sink contains exactly 11 liters of water. If water is drained from the sink until it holds exactly 5 liters of water less than the quantity drained away, how many liters of water were drained away?	"Given that the sink initially contains 11 liters of water and after draining some water, it holds exactly 5 liters less than the quantity drained away.

Let's assume x liters of water were drained away. 
So, the amount left in the sink would be x - 5 liters.

According to the problem, the total amount of water in the sink is 11 liters.
Therefore, we can write an equation:
Amount drained + Amount left = Total amount
x + (x - 5) = 11
2x - 5 = 11

"Given that 300 billion French francs is equivalent to 50 billion United States dollars, we can set up a proportion to find the number of United States dollars equivalent to f francs.

Let's represent the number of United States dollars as x. The proportion can be set up as:
300 billion / 50 billion = f / x

Solving for x:
x = (50/300) * f
x = (1/6) * f
x = f/6

There are two friends A and B. A starts with his car at the speed 40 kmph. B starts one hour later from the same place, in the same direction on his bike at the speed of 50 kmph. After how many hours will they meet ?	"To find out after how many hours friends A and B will meet, we can set up an equation based on the distance they both travel when they meet.

Let the time taken for them to meet be \( t \) hours. Friend A travels at 40 km/hr for \( t \) hours, covering a distance of \( 40t \) km. Friend B starts one hour later and travels at 50 km/hr for \( t-1 \) hours (as he started one hour later), covering a distance of \( 50(t-1) \) km.

When they meet, the total distance covered by both friends should be the same:
\[ 40t = 50(t-1) \]

Solving this equation gives:
\[ 40t = 50t - 50 \]
\[ 10t = 50 \]
\[ t = \frac{50}{10} = 5\text{ hours} \]

Therefore, they will meet after \(5\) hours.

Varsha bought a Laptop for $1060, which was the retail price plus a 6 percent sales tax. How much money could she have saved if she had bought the stereo at the same retail price in a neighboring state where she would have paid a sales tax of 5 percent?	"Let's break down the given information:
- Varsha bought a laptop for $1060, which includes a 6% sales tax.
- Let the retail price of the laptop be x dollars.
- The total amount she paid, including tax, is $1060.

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:
x + 0.06x = 1060
1.06x = 1060
x = 1060 / 1.06
x = $1000

So, the retail price of the laptop was $1000.

Now, let's calculate how much Varsha would have paid in a neighboring state with a 5% sales tax on a retail price of $1000:
Amount paid with a 5% tax = Retail Price + (5% * Retail Price)
Amount paid with a 5% tax = $1000 + (0.05 * $1000)
Amount paid with a 5% tax = $1000 + $50
Amount paid with a 5% tax = $1050

The difference in what she actually spent and what she could have spent is:
$1060 - $1050 = $10

Therefore, Varsha could have saved $10 if she"
Every day a cyclist meets a train at a particular crossing. The road is straight before the crossing and both are travelling in the same direction. The cyclist travels with a speed of 10 kmph. One day the cyclist comes late by 25 min and meets the train 5km before the crossing. What is the speed of the train?	"Given:
Speed of the cyclist = 10 km/hr
The cyclist comes late by 25 minutes = 25/60 hr = 5/12 hr
Distance traveled by the train before meeting the cyclist = 5 km

Let's denote the speed of the train as T km/hr.

Rationale:
When the cyclist is late, he covers a distance equal to his speed multiplied by the time he was late. This distance is covered before reaching the crossing point where they meet.

1. The distance covered by the cyclist in being late: 
= Speed of cyclist * Time he was late
= 10 km/hr * (5/12) hr
= 50/12 km

2. Since they meet at this point, it means that when they both started from their respective positions, they were apart by this distance.
So, when both start from their initial positions and travel towards each other,
the relative speed between them is:
Relative speed = Speed of train + Speed of cyclist

3. Time taken to meet after being apart for this extra distance:
= Distance / Relative speed
= (50/12) / (T + 10)

4. Given that time taken for them to meet is also equal to being late plus traveling together normally until"
The promoters of the Springfield music festival estimated a 60 percent increase in ticket sales from last year, but because of bad weather, ticket sales actually decreased by 20 percent from last year’s level. What percent of the projected ticket sales were the actual ticket sales?	"To find the percent of the projected ticket sales that were the actual ticket sales, we can follow these steps:

1. Let's assume last year's ticket sales were represented by 100 units for easier calculation.
2. The estimated increase this year would be 60% more than last year: 100 + (60% of 100) = 160 units.
3. Due to bad weather, the actual ticket sales decreased by 20% from last year's level: 100 - (20% of 100) = 80 units.

Now, we need to find what percent of the projected (estimated) ticket sales were the actual ticket sales:
Actual Ticket Sales / Projected Ticket Sales * 100
= (80 / 160) * 100
= 0.5 * 100
= 50

Therefore, Answer: B)50"
Two trains are running with speed 30 km/hr. and 58km/hr. in the same direction. A man in the slower train passes the faster train in 18 seconds. The length (in metres) of the faster trains is:	"Given:
Speed of slower train = 30 km/hr
Speed of faster train = 58 km/hr
Relative speed = Speed of faster train - Speed of slower train
Relative speed = 58 km/hr - 30 km/hr = 28 km/hr

We need to convert the relative speed from km/hr to m/s as the time is given in seconds.
1 km/hr = (5/18) m/s
So, relative speed = 28 * (5/18) m/s = 140/9 m/s

Time taken to pass the faster train = 18 seconds

Distance covered by the faster train in this time is equal to its length.
Let the length of the faster train be L meters.

The formula for distance traveled is: Distance = Speed * Time
L = (140/9) * 18
L = 20 * 18
L = 360 meters

Therefore, the length of the faster trains is:
Answer: E) None of these"
A girl counted in the following way on the fingers of her left hand : She started by calling the thumb 1, the index finger 2, middle finger 3, ring finger 4, little finger 5 and then reversed direction calling the ring finger 6, middle finger 7 and so on. She counted upto 1994. She ended counting on which finger ?	"To solve this problem, we first need to understand the pattern in which the girl counts on her fingers. She starts by counting from 1 to 5 on her fingers in one direction and then reverses and counts from 6 onwards back to 1.

We can observe that she completes a full cycle of counting every 8 numbers (from 1 to 8). So, after every multiple of 8, she will end up at the thumb again.

Now, we need to find out how many complete cycles she has completed before reaching or exceeding 1994:

1994 divided by 8 gives us a quotient of 249 with a remainder of 2. This means she has completed full cycles up to \(8 \times 249 =1992\) and then counted two more numbers.

Since she ends at the thumb after completing each cycle, after counting two more numbers beyond the last complete cycle, she would end at the middle finger.

Therefore, Answer: C) Middle finger"
Rick can recite the entirety of Macbeth in 183 minutes. His grandson Morty has agreed to listen to Slippy recite Macbeth but doesn't really want to and so is planning to sneak away after 10 minutes and then come back five minutes before the end, as he knows Rick will be too self-absorbed to realise his absence. During this time he is planning to use an intergalactic portal to instantly teleport to an arcade, Blips and Chitz, and play his favorite virtual reality game, Life of Roy. If every round of Life of Roy takes 19 minutes, how many complete rounds can Morty play and still get back to Rick's recital in time?	"To solve this question step by step:

1. Morty plans to listen to Rick's recital for 183 minutes but sneak away after 10 minutes and return five minutes before the end, which means he will be away for a total of 183 - 10 - 5 = 168 minutes.

2. Each round of Morty's favorite game, Life of Roy, takes 19 minutes.

3. To find out how many complete rounds Morty can play within the time he is away, we divide the total time he is away (168 minutes) by the time it takes for each round (19 minutes):
   Number of complete rounds = Total time away / Time per round
                             = 168 / 19
                             ≈ 8.84

4. Since Morty can only play complete rounds and cannot start a new one if he needs to return five minutes before the end of Rick's recital, Morty can play a maximum of **8** complete rounds and still get back in time.

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: B) **8**"
Country Club has an indoor swimming club. Thirty percent of the members of a swim club have passed the lifesaving test. Among the members who have not passed the test, 12 have taken the preparatory course and 30 have not taken the course. How many members are there in the swim club?	"To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

Let's denote the total number of members in the swim club as \( x \).

Given that 30% of the members have passed the lifesaving test, then 70% have not passed the test.

Among those who have not passed the test:
- 12 members have taken the preparatory course.
- 30 members have not taken the course.

Therefore, we can create an equation based on this information:

Number of members who have not passed = Number who took preparatory course + Number who did not take preparatory course
\(0.7x = 12 + 30\)

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\(0.7x = 42\)  
\(x = \frac{42}{0.7}\)  
\(x = 60\)

So, there are a total of 60 members in the swim club.

"Recently, scientists were able to sequence an individual's humane genome in just 4 weeks using a super fast modern computer. A computer manufactured just 2 years earlier would have taken 24 weeks to do the same amount of work.
For more targeted treatment of his cancer, Steve needs his human genome to be sequenced as soon as possible and scientists plan to use both the super fast modern computer and the 2 year-old computer to get the job done. Assuming both computers can tackle discrete components of the genome sequencing process, how many days should doctors expect to have the results of Steve's human genome sequencing project?"	"Given:
- Time taken by the super-fast modern computer to sequence an individual's genome = 4 weeks
- Time taken by a computer manufactured 2 years earlier to do the same work = 24 weeks

Let's first find the efficiency ratio of the super-fast modern computer compared to the older one:
Efficiency ratio = Older computer time / Modern computer time
Efficiency ratio = 24 weeks / 4 weeks
Efficiency ratio = 6

This means that the super-fast modern computer is 6 times faster than the older computer in sequencing genomes.

Now, when both computers work together, their combined efficiency is additive. So, if we consider their combined efficiency as x (where x is a factor),
x + 6x = Total efficiency when working together
7x = Total efficiency when working together

Since they can complete sequencing Steve's genome in one day working together,
7x = 1
x = 1/7

Therefore, each day they can complete \( \frac{1}{7} \) of Steve's genome.

To find out how many days it will take for them to finish sequencing Steve's genome:

A shop gives 10% discount on the purchase of an item. If paid for in cash immediately, a further discount of 12% is given. If the original price of the item is Rs. 250, what is the price of the article if a cash purchase is made?	"Let's solve the question step by step:

Given:
Original price of the item = Rs. 250
First discount given = 10%
Second discount given for immediate cash payment = 12%

Step 1: Calculate the first discount:
First discount = 10% of Rs. 250
First discount = (10/100) * 250
First discount = Rs. 25

Step 2: Calculate the price after the first discount:
Price after first discount = Original price - First discount
Price after first discount = Rs. 250 - Rs. 25
Price after first discount = Rs. 225

Step 3: Calculate the second discount for immediate cash payment:
Second discount = 12% of Price after first discount
Second discount = (12/100) * Rs. 225
Second discount = Rs. (0.12 * 225)
Second Discount=Rs27

Step4: Calculate final price with both discounts applied:
Final Price= Price After First Discount- Second Discount 
Final Price=Rs(225-27)
Final Price=Rs198

Therefore, if a cash purchase is made, the price of the article would be Rs.198.

When an item is sold for Rs. 18,700 the owner loses 15%. At what price should that plot be sold for a gain of 15%?	"Let's denote the cost price of the plot as CP.

Given that when the item is sold for Rs. 18,700, the owner loses 15%. This means that selling price (SP) is 85% of the cost price:
\[0.85 \times CP = 18700\]

To find the cost price (CP), we divide both sides by 0.85:
\[CP = \frac{18700}{0.85}\]
\[CP = 22000\]

Now, we need to calculate the selling price for a gain of 15%. The selling price with a gain of 15% can be calculated as follows:
\[SP = CP + \text{Gain}\]
\[SP = CP + (0.15 \times CP)\]
\[SP = CP(1 + 0.15)\]
\[SP = CP(1.15)\]
\[SP = 22000(1.15)\]
\[SP = Rs.\:25300\]

Therefore, the plot should be sold for a gain of 15% at Rs.\:25300.

Answer: B)25300"
A loan was repaid in two annual instalments of Rs.112 each. If the rate of interest be 10% per annum compounded annually, the sum borrowed was :	"To find the sum borrowed, we can set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's denote the sum borrowed as P.

After one year, the amount to be repaid is 112 and the remaining amount to be repaid after two years is also 112. 

So, after one year:
P + P*10/100 = P + 0.1P = 1.1P

After two years:
1.1P + 0.1(1.1P) = 112

Solving this equation will give us the value of P.

A banana costs Rs.3 and an apple costs Rs.4. What will be the total cost of 4 dozen of apples and bananas?	"Given:
Cost of a banana = Rs. 3
Cost of an apple = Rs. 4

To find the total cost of 4 dozen (48) apples and bananas:

Number of bananas in 4 dozens = 48/2 = 24
Total cost of bananas in 4 dozens = Cost per banana * Number of bananas = Rs. 3 * 24

Number of apples in 4 dozens = 48/2 = 24
Total cost of apples in 4 dozens = Cost per apple * Number of apples = Rs. 4 * 24

Total cost for both fruits in four dozens= Total cost for bananas + Total cost for apples 

Rationale: Calculating the total cost by multiplying the number and individual costs gives us the total amount spent on buying all the fruits.

Total man-hours = 4 * 6
Total man-hours = 24

Now, we know that it takes a total of 24 man-hours to complete the job. Since we now have double the number of men (8 instead of 4), we can divide the total man-hours by the new number of men to find out how many hours it will take for them to complete the job:
Hours = Total man-hours / Number of men
Hours = 24 / 8
Hours = 3

Therefore, it will take 8 men a total of 3 hours to repair the road if they work at the same rate.

Company X has 40 employees and company Y has 50 employees. Both companies have the same number of full time employees, but company Y has 4 more than twice the number of part-time employees that Company X has. How many part-time employees does Company Y have?	"Let's denote the number of full-time employees in Company X as \(x\) and the number of part-time employees in Company X as \(y\).

Given:
- Company X has 40 employees, so the total number of employees in Company X is \(x + y = 40\).
- Company Y has 50 employees.
- Both companies have the same number of full-time employees, so the number of full-time employees in Company Y is also \(x\).
- Company Y has 4 more than twice the number of part-time employees that Company X has, which means the number of part-time employees in Company Y is \(2y + 4\).

Now we can set up a system of equations to solve for \(x\) and \(y\):
1. From the first point: 
\(x + y = 40\)  
2. From the second and third points: 
\(x + (2y + 4) = 50\)  

Solving these two equations simultaneously will give us the values for both x and y.

Rationale:  
From equation (1), we get:  
\(x = 40 - y\)  

Substitute this into equation (2):  
\(40 - y + (2y + "
"If 2s > 8 and 4t < 12, which of the following could be the value of s-t?
I. -1
II. 0
III. 1"	"Given inequalities:
1. 2s > 8
2. 4t < 12

To find the possible values of s-t, we need to analyze each option:

I. If s-t = -1:
   Let's test this with the given inequalities:
   If s = 0 and t = 1, then 2(0) > 8 is false and 4(1) < 12 is true.
   So, s-t cannot be -1.

II. If s-t = 0:
   Let's test this with the given inequalities:
   If s = t = 0, then both inequalities are false.
   So, s-t cannot be equal to zero.

III. If s-t = 1:
   Let's test this with the given inequalities:
   If s = t + 1, then for t=0: 
       - When t=0, if we choose t=0 and substitute in (2), we get: 
         \(2(t+1) >8 \Rightarrow\) \(2>8\), which is false.

After measuring 200 meters of a rope. It was discovered that the measuring meter rod was three centimeters longer. The true length of the rope measured is	"Given:
Length of the measuring meter rod = 3 cm
Measured length using this rod = 200 meters

Let x be the true length of the rope.

According to the problem, when measured with a rod that is 3 cm longer, it measures as if it is 200 meters. This means that the actual length plus the extra length due to the rod equals 200 meters.

Therefore, we can set up an equation:
x + 3 cm = 200 m

Now, convert centimeters to meters (1 meter = 100 centimeters):
3 cm = 3/100 m = 0.03 m

Substitute this back into our equation:
x + 0.03 m = 200 m
x = 200 m - 0.03 m
x = 199.97 meters

Rationale: The true length of the rope measured is approximately equal to 
199.97 meters which can be rounded off to nearest whole number as 
approximately equal to 'A)208m'.

Answer: A)208m"
ASB is a quarter circle. PQRS is a rectangle with sides PQ = 8 and PS = 6. What is the length of the arc AQB ?	"To find the length of the arc AQB, we need to calculate the circumference of the quarter circle ASB and then find what fraction of that circumference is represented by the arc AQB.

Given:
- PQ = 8
- PS = 6

First, let's find the radius of the quarter circle ASB:
The diagonal PR of rectangle PQRS is also a diameter of the quarter circle. Using Pythagorean theorem:
PR^2 = PQ^2 + PS^2
PR^2 = 8^2 + 6^2
PR^2 = 64 + 36
PR^2 = 100
PR = √100
PR = 10

Since ASB is a quarter circle, its circumference C can be calculated as:
C = π * diameter /4
C = π * PR /4
C = π * 10 /4
C = (5/2)π

Now, to find the length of arc AQB which is one-fourth of this circumference:
Length of arc AQB= (1/4) * C 
Length of arc AQB= (1/4) * (5/2)π 
Length of arc AQB= (5/8)π"
"In a village, there are four tribes located at different distances from each other. Tribe R is 60 miles away from Tribe P; Tribe S 40 miles away from Tribe B and Tribe R is 10 miles nearer to the Tribe S than it is to Tribe Q.
How far is the Tribe S located from the tribe P ?"	"Given:
- Tribe R is 60 miles away from Tribe P.
- Tribe S is 40 miles away from Tribe B.
- Tribe R is 10 miles nearer to the Tribe S than it is to Tribe Q.

Let's denote the distance between Tribes as follows:
- Distance between Tribes R and P = RP = 60 miles
- Distance between Tribes S and B = SB = 40 miles
- Distance between Tribes R and Q = RQ
- Distance between Tribes S and Q = SQ

From the information given, we have:
RP - RQ = RS - RQ
60 - RQ = RS - (RS - SQ)
60 - RQ = SQ

Since we know that SB (distance between S and B) is equal to 40 miles, we can substitute this into our equation:
SQ + SB = QB
SQ + 40 = QB

Now, substituting back into our previous equation, we get:
60 - RQ = SQ
RQ + SQ + 40= QB + SQ 
RQ + (60-RQ) + 40= QB +(60-RB)

Solving these equations simultaneously,
Rearranging terms in first equation gives:

A 2 metre broad pathway is to be constructed around a rectangular plot on the inside. The area of the plots is 96 sq.m. The rate of construction is Rs. 50 per square metre. Find the total cost of the construction?	"Given:
Area of the rectangular plot = 96 sq.m
Width of the pathway = 2 m

Let the length of the rectangular plot be x meters. Then, its width would be (x - 4) meters (since a 2-meter pathway is constructed around it).

The total area including the pathway can be calculated as:
Total area = Area of plot + Area of pathway
Total area = (x)(x-4) + 96

Since we know that Total area = x(x-4) + 96 and given that Rate of construction is Rs.50 per square meter, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying Total area with rate.

Now, substituting x(x-4) + 96 for Total area in terms of x:
Total cost = Rs.50 * [x(x-4) + 96]

To find x, we use the fact that Area of plot is equal to length times width:
x(x - 4) = 96
Expanding this equation gives us: 
x^2 - 4x - 96 =0
Factoring this quadratic equation gives us: 
(x -12)(x+8)=0
This yields two possible solutions: x=12 or x=-8

John needs to mix a cleaning solution in the following ratio: 1 part bleach for every 4 parts water. When mixing the solution, John makes a mistake and mixes in half as much bleach as he ought to have. The total solution consists of 36 ml. How many ml of bleach did John put into the solution?	"To find out how many ml of bleach John put into the solution, we first need to determine the correct ratio of bleach to water based on the given information.

Given:
- The correct ratio is 1 part bleach for every 4 parts water.
- John mixes in half as much bleach as he should have.
- The total solution consists of 36 ml.

Let x be the amount of bleach that should have been added. Since John made a mistake and mixed in half as much bleach, he actually added x/2 ml of bleach.

According to the correct ratio, the total number of parts in the mixture is 1 (bleach) + 4 (water) = 5 parts.

Now we can set up an equation based on the total volume of the solution:

x/2 + 4x = 36

Solving for x:
x/2 + 4x = 36
Multiply by 2 to get rid of fraction: 
x + 8x =72
Combine like terms: 
9x =72
Divide by 9: 
x=8

Therefore, John should have added 8 ml of bleach into the solution.

Of the new vehicles registered in a week, 300 were neither SUVs nor were they powered by diesel. 3/4th of the SUVs registered were diesel powered and there were half as many SUVs as there were non SUVs. If SUVs not powered by diesel were a sixth of non SUVs not powered by diesel, how many vehicles V registered in the week were powered by diesel?	"Let's break down the information given in the question:

Let:
- Total vehicles registered in a week be V
- Number of SUVs be S
- Number of non-SUVs be N
- Number of diesel-powered vehicles be D

From the information given:
1. 300 vehicles were neither SUVs nor diesel-powered, so N = 300.
2. There were half as many SUVs as there were non-SUVs, so S = N/2.
3. 3/4th of the SUVs registered were diesel-powered, so D = (3/4)*S.
4. SUVs not powered by diesel were a sixth of non-SUVs not powered by diesel, which means (S - D) = (1/6)*(N - D).

Now we can substitute the known values into these equations and solve for D:

Substitute N = 300 into S = N/2: S = 300/2 => S = 150.

Substitute S = 150 into D = (3/4)*S: D = (3/4)*150 => D=112.5.

Substitute N=300 and D=112.5 into (S - D) = (1/6)*("
Bill owns a large collection of fishing lures consisting of small, medium, and large lures that weigh 3, 4, and 5 grams each, respectively. If the product of the lure weights that Bill sold to his friend is 216,000 grams, how many medium lures did he sell?	"Given:
- The weights of the small, medium, and large lures are 3 grams, 4 grams, and 5 grams respectively.
- The product of the lure weights that Bill sold to his friend is 216,000 grams.

Let's denote the number of small lures as x, the number of medium lures as y, and the number of large lures as z.

We can set up an equation based on the given information:
3x * 4y * 5z = 216,000

Simplify this equation:
60xyz = 216,000
xyz = 3,600

Since we are looking for the number of medium lures (y), which have a weight of 4 grams each:
y = total weight / (weight per medium lure)
y = 3,600 / 4
y = 900

Therefore, Bill sold a total of **900 medium lures** to his friend.

A wire is cut into three equal parts. The resulting segments are then cut into 6, 8, and 10 equal parts, respectively. If each of the resulting segments has an integer length, what is the minimum length of the wire?	"Given that the wire is cut into three equal parts, let's denote the length of each part as x.

After cutting the first part into 6 equal segments, each segment will have a length of x/6.
After cutting the second part into 8 equal segments, each segment will have a length of x/8.
After cutting the third part into 10 equal segments, each segment will have a length of x/10.

Since all resulting segments have an integer length, it means that x must be divisible by 6, 8, and 10. Therefore, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6, 8, and 10 to determine the minimum length of the wire.

Calculating LCM(6, 8, 10):
Prime factorization:
- \(6 = 2 *3\)
- \(8 =2^3\)
- \(10 =2*5\)

LCM(6, 8 ,10) = \(2^3 *3*5=120\).

Therefore,

An engineering student has to secure 36% marks to pass. He gets 130 marks and fails by 14 marks. The maximum number of marks obtained by him is?	"Given:
Passing marks = 36%
Marks secured by the student = 130
Student fails by 14 marks

Let x be the maximum number of marks obtainable.

To calculate the passing marks:
Passing Marks = 36% of x
Passing Marks = (36/100) * x

Since the student secured 130 marks and failed by 14, we can set up an equation:
(36/100) * x - 14 = 130

Solving for x:
(36/100) * x = 130 + 14
0.36x = 144
x = 144 / 0.36
x ≈ 400

Therefore, the maximum number of marks obtainable is approximately equal to 400.

A soda can, in the shape of a circular cylinder, is 3/4 full of soda. If the volume of soda in the can is 72π cubic inches and the diameter of the can is 8 inches, then what is the height, in inches, of the can?	"Given:
- Volume of soda in the can = 72π cubic inches
- Diameter of the can = 8 inches
- The can is 3/4 full of soda

Let's first find the radius of the circular cylinder using the diameter provided:
Radius (r) = Diameter / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4 inches

The volume V of a cylinder is given by V = πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.

Since the can is only 3/4 full, we need to find out how much volume corresponds to this amount. 
Volume when it's completely full: V_full = π(4)^2h
Volume when it's 3/4 full: V_3/4_full = (3/4) * π(4)^2h

Given that V_3/4_full equals to 72π cubic inches, we have:
(3/4) * π(16)h = 72π
12πh = 72π
h = 6

Therefore, the height of the can is h=6 inches.

Three quarts of a bleaching chemical, Minum, contains 5 percent hydrogen peroxide and water. A different type of bleaching chemical, Maxim, which contains 20 percent hydrogen peroxide, will be mixed with the three quarts of Minum. How much of type Maxim should be added to the three quarts of Minum so that the resulting mixture contains 10 percent hydrogen peroxide?	"Given:
- Minum contains 5% hydrogen peroxide.
- Maxim contains 20% hydrogen peroxide.
- The resulting mixture should contain 10% hydrogen peroxide.

Let x be the amount of Maxim (in quarts) to be added to the three quarts of Minum.

Rationale:
- The amount of hydrogen peroxide in Minum = 5% of 3 quarts = 0.05 * 3 = 0.15 quarts.
- The amount of hydrogen peroxide in Maxim = 20% of x quarts = 0.2x quarts.
- The total amount of the resulting mixture is (3 + x) quarts.
- To find the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the resulting mixture, we set up an equation:

(0.15 + 0.2x) / (3 + x) = 0.10

Solving this equation will give us the value of x, which represents how much Maxim should be added to achieve a mixture with a concentration of 10% hydrogen peroxide.

The total weight of a tin and the cookies it contains is 2 pounds. After 3/4 of the cookies are eaten, the tin and the remaining cookies weigh 0.8 pounds. What is the weight of the empty tin in pounds?	"Let's denote the weight of the empty tin as x pounds and the total weight of the cookies as y pounds.

Given:
1. x + y = 2 (total weight of a tin and cookies is 2 pounds)
2. After eating 3/4 of the cookies, the remaining weight is 0.8 pounds: x + (1/4)y = 0.8

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y.

From equation 1:
x = 2 - y

Substitute this into equation 2:
2 - y + (1/4)y = 0.8
Multiplying by 4 to clear fractions:
8 - 4y + y = 3.2
Rearranging terms:
-3y = -4.8
Dividing by -3 on both sides:
y = 1.6

Now, substitute back into x = 2 - y:
x = 0.4

Therefore, the weight of the empty tin is x = **0.4** pounds.

In how many ways to choose a group of 3 people from 6 couples so that no couple is chosen	"To solve this problem, we can first choose 3 people from the 12 individuals (6 couples) and then divide by 3! to account for the different ways of arranging the chosen group since order doesn't matter.

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. Choose 3 people from the 12 individuals: This can be done in C(12, 3) ways.
   C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to choose.
   C(12, 3) = 12! / (3!(12-3)!) = 220 ways.

2. Divide by 3! to account for different arrangements within the group:
   There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange a group of three people.

Now, let's find out how many groups of three people can be formed without any couple being chosen:

Total ways = C(12, 3) / 3!
Total ways = 220 / 6
Total ways = **36**

Eesha has a wheat business. She purchases wheat from a local wholesaler of a particular cost per pound. The price of the wheat of her stores is $3 per kg. Her faulty spring balance reads 0.9 kg for a KG. Also in the festival season, she gives a 10% discount on the wheat. She found that she made neither a profit nor a loss in the festival season. At what price did Eesha purchase the wheat from the wholesaler ?	"Given:
Price of wheat in Eesha's store = $3 per kg
Faulty spring balance reads 0.9 kg for a true 1 kg

Let's assume the cost price of wheat per pound from the wholesaler is x dollars.

To find out at what price Eesha purchased the wheat from the wholesaler, we need to consider the following steps:

1. Convert the cost price from pounds to kilograms:
Since her faulty spring balance reads 0.9 kg for a true 1 kg, this means she actually gets 0.9 kg for every x dollars spent.
So, cost price per kilogram = x / 0.9

2. Calculate how much she paid for each kilogram of wheat:
If she buys at a rate of x / 0.9 dollars per kilogram and sells at $3 per kilogram with a 10% discount during the festival season (which results in no profit or loss), then her selling price during the festival season would be $3 * (1 - 10%) = $2.70.

Since there is no profit or loss, her buying price should equal her selling price after applying the discount.
Therefore, x / 0.9 = $2.70

A train does a journey without stopping for 8 hours. If it had traveled 5 km an hour faster, it would have done the journey in 6 hours 40 min. What is its slower speed?	"Given:
- Let the original speed of the train be x km/hr.
- The time taken at the original speed = 8 hours.
- If the train had traveled 5 km/hr faster, its new speed would be (x + 5) km/hr.
- The time taken at the increased speed = 6 hours and 40 minutes = 6.67 hours.

Using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time

At original speed:
Distance = x km/hr * 8 hr

At increased speed:
Distance = (x + 5) km/hr * 6.67 hr

Since both distances are equal:

x * 8 = (x + 5) * 6.67
8x = 6.67x +33.35
1.33x=33.35
x=25

Therefore, the slower speed of the train is x = 25 kmph.

Answer: B)25 kmph"
The spherical ball of lead 3 cm in diameter is melted and recast into 3 spherical balls. The diameters of two of these are 1 1/2 cm and 2 cm respectively. The diameter of third ball is?	"To solve this problem, we need to understand that the volume of a sphere is proportional to the cube of its radius. 

Given:
- The original lead ball has a diameter of 3 cm, so its radius is 1.5 cm.
- After melting and recasting, it forms three spherical balls.

Let's denote the diameter of the third ball as x cm. Therefore, its radius will be x/2 cm.

According to the conservation of volume:
Volume of original ball = Volume of three new balls
4/3 * π * (1.5)^3 = 4/3 * π * (0.75)^3 + 4/3 * π * (1)^3 + 4/3 * π * (x/2)^3

Solving this equation will give us the value of x, which is the diameter of the third ball.

Now let's calculate it step by step:

1. Calculate the volumes on both sides:
(4/3)π(1.5)^3 = (4/3)π(0.75)^3 + (4/3)π(1)^3 + (4/9)π(x^3)

A rope can make 70 rounds of the circumference of a cylinder whose radius of the base is 14cm. how many times can it go round a cylinder having radius 20 cm?	"Given:
Radius of the first cylinder, r1 = 14 cm
Number of rounds on the first cylinder, n1 = 70

Let's find the circumference of the first cylinder:
Circumference = 2 * π * r1
Circumference = 2 * 3.14 * 14
Circumference ≈ 87.92 cm

Now, let's find how many times the rope can go around a cylinder with radius 20 cm.

Radius of the second cylinder, r2 = 20 cm

Let x be the number of rounds on the second cylinder.
We know that for both cylinders, the length of rope used is constant.

So,
Number of rounds on second cylinder, n2 = x

The circumference for both cylinders will be equal:
2 * π * r1 * n1 = 2 * π * r2 * n2
87.92 * 70 = 125.6x
6154.4 ≈125.6x
x ≈6154.4 /125.6 
x ≈49 

Therefore, it can make approximately 49 rounds around a cylinder with a radius of 20 cm.

The steamer going upstream would cover the distance between Town A and Town B in 5 hours. The same steamer going downstream would cover the distance between the towns in 3 hours. How long would it take a raft moving at the speed of the current to float from B to A?	"Given:
Let the speed of the steamer be S and the speed of the current be C.
When going upstream, the effective speed is (S - C) and when going downstream, it is (S + C).

Rationale:
1. The time taken to travel from A to B upstream is 5 hours. So, distance = 5(S - C).
2. The time taken to travel from B to A downstream is 3 hours. So, distance = 3(S + C).

Calculations:
Distance between A and B = Distance between B and A
5(S - C) = 3(S + C)
5S - 5C = 3S + 3C
2S = 8C
S = 4C

Now, for a raft moving at the speed of the current:
Speed of raft in still water = Speed of steamer in still water (as given that they cover distances in equal times)
Raft's speed in still water = S - C
= 4C - C
= 3C

Time taken for raft to float from B to A:
Distance between B and A / Speed of raft in still water
= Distance between B and A / (3C)

Rijon is the bass player in a wedding band which has 9 musicians. When the gig is over, the manager collects the payment of $1000 from the bride and groom. The manager has a fee of $100.00 for booking the gig. How much will the manager have to give each musician in order to pay them equally?	"To find out how much each musician will receive, we first need to calculate the total amount that will be distributed among the musicians after deducting the manager's fee.

Total payment collected from bride and groom = $1000
Manager's fee = $100

Amount available for musicians = Total payment - Manager's fee
Amount available for musicians = $1000 - $100
Amount available for musicians = $900

Since there are 9 musicians in total, we divide the amount available for musicians by the number of musicians to find out how much each musician will receive.

Each musician's share = Amount available for musicians / Number of musicians
Each musician's share = $900 / 9
Each musician's share = $100

Therefore, each musician will receive $100 in order to pay them equally.

The population of a city increases at the rate of 4% per annum. There is an additional annual increase of 1% in the population due to the influx of job seekers. Therefore, the % increase in the population after 2 years will be :	"To calculate the total percentage increase in the population after 2 years considering both the 4% annual increase and the additional 1% increase due to job seekers, we can use the concept of compound interest formula for percentage increase.

Let's denote:
- Initial population as P
- Annual rate of increase without job seekers as r1 = 4%
- Additional annual rate of increase due to job seekers as r2 = 1%

After one year, the population will be:
P + (r1/100)*P + (r2/100)*P = P*(1 + r1/100 + r2/100)

After two years, the population will be:
(P*(1 + r1/100 + r2/100))*(1 + r1/100 + r2/100)
= P*(1.04)*(1.01) [Expanding]

Therefore, % Increase in Population after 2 years = [(Final Population - Initial Population) / Initial Population] * 100
= [(P*1.04*1.01 - P) / P] * 100
= [(P*1.0504 - P) / P] * 100
= (0.0504 / 10) * "
In your study are displayed your 5 favourite puzzle books. If you decide to arrange the five books in every possible combination and moved just one book every minute, how long would it take you ?	"To solve this question, we need to calculate the total number of ways the 5 books can be arranged and then convert that into minutes.

Given that there are 5 books, the total number of ways they can be arranged is given by 5 factorial (5!). 

So, \( 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 \) ways.

Since you move one book every minute, it would take you a total of 120 minutes to go through all possible combinations.

Converting this into hours:
\(120\text{ minutes} = \frac{120}{60} = 2\text{ hours}\)

Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: B)2 hours"
A cheerleading squad practices 1 hour a day from Monday through Thursday for a competition on Saturday. How many hours would they need to practice on Friday in order to have practiced an average of 2 hours a day over the 5 days from Monday through Friday?	"To find the average hours of practice per day over 5 days, we can first calculate the total hours they need to practice in those 5 days and then divide by 5.

Given:
- They practice 1 hour a day from Monday through Thursday, so that's 4 days.
- They have a competition on Saturday, which is the fifth day.
- Let x be the number of hours they need to practice on Friday.

Total hours needed for 5 days = Total days * Average hours per day
Total hours needed for 5 days = 5 * 2 = 10

Total hours practiced from Monday through Thursday = 4 * 1 = 4

Therefore, the total additional hours needed on Friday to meet the average is:
10 - (hours practiced from Monday through Thursday) = x
10 - 4 = x
x =6

So, they would need to practice for an additional **6** hours on Friday in order to have practiced an average of **2** hours a day over the **5** days.

Therefore, Answer: C)6"
A certain business printer can print 100 characters per second, which is 5 times faster than an average printer. If an average printer can print 4 times faster than an electric typewriter, how many characters per minute can an electric typewriter print?	"Given:
- Business printer speed = 100 characters per second
- Business printer is 5 times faster than an average printer
- Average printer speed = 100/5 = 20 characters per second
- Average printer is 4 times faster than an electric typewriter

Let's calculate the speed of the electric typewriter:
Electric typewriter speed = 20/4 = 5 characters per second

To find out how many characters per minute the electric typewriter can print, we need to convert its speed from seconds to minutes:
Characters per minute = (5 characters/second) * (60 seconds/minute) = 300 characters per minute

Therefore, the answer is:

50% of all high school students hate roller coasters; the rest love them. 20% of those students who love roller coasters own chinchillas. What percentage of students love roller coasters but do not own a chinchilla?	"To find the percentage of students who love roller coasters but do not own a chinchilla, we can break down the information given in the question:

Let's assume there are 100 high school students:
- 50% hate roller coasters, so 50% love them.
- Out of those who love roller coasters (50 students), 20% own chinchillas.

Now, to find out how many students love roller coasters but do not own a chinchilla:
Number of students who love roller coasters and own chinchillas = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10
Number of students who love roller coasters but do not own chinchillas = Total number loving roller coasters - Number owning chinchillas
= 50 - 10
= 40

Therefore, out of the total number of high school students (100):
40 students love roller coasters but do not own a chinchilla.

So, the percentage of students who love roller coasters but do not own a chinchilla is:
(40/100) * 100% = **40%**

Therefore,
**Answer: B) 40%**"
The binary representation of 0.6875 is ?	"To convert a decimal number to binary, we can use the following steps:

1. Multiply the decimal number by 2.

A letter has to be printed 100 lines with 80 character, if the same letter is printed with 40 characters per line, how many lines will it have?	"Given:
- A letter has to be printed 100 lines with 80 characters.
- The same letter is printed with 40 characters per line.

Let's calculate the total number of characters in the first case:
Total characters = 100 lines * 80 characters/line

Now, we need to find out how many lines will be needed if each line contains 40 characters. 

To find this, we can use the formula:
Number of lines = Total characters / Characters per line

Rationale: 
In the first case, there are 100 lines with each line containing 80 characters. So, the total number of characters is 100 * 80 = 8000.

Now, if each line contains only 40 characters in the second case, then the number of lines needed would be:
Number of lines = Total characters / Characters per line
Number of lines = 8000 / 40
Number of lines =200

Therefore, Answer: A)200"
The sum of 3rd and 15th elements of an arithmetic progression is equal to the sum of the 6th, 11th and 13th elements of the same progression. Then, which element of the series should necessarily be equal to zero ?	"Let's denote the first term of the arithmetic progression as \( a \) and the common difference as \( d \).

The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic progression is given by:
\[ T_n = a + (n-1)d \]

Given that the sum of the 3rd and 15th elements is equal to the sum of the 6th, 11th, and 13th elements:
\[ T_3 + T_{15} = T_6 + T_{11} + T_{13} \]

Substitute in the formulas for these terms:
\[ (a+2d) + (a+14d) = (a+5d) + (a+10d) + (a+12d) \]
\[ Simplifying: 2a + 16d = 3a + 27d \]
\[ Rearranging: a = -11d \]

Since we have found that \( a = -11d \), this means that all terms in this arithmetic progression are multiples of -11. Therefore, necessarily, the element which should be equal to zero is when n is such that \( a+(n-1)d = -11(n-1)d = 0\).

Therefore"
A printer started its work at 8.15 a.m and ended its work at 9.20 p.m. It was interrupted twice for the time duration of 42 min. It can print 100 instructions per hour. Approximate how many instructions it printed?	"Given:
- The printer started at 8:15 a.m. and ended at 9:20 p.m., which is a total of \(13\) hours and \(5\) minutes.
- The printer was interrupted twice for \(42\) minutes each time, so the total interruption time is \(2 \times 42 = 84\) minutes or \(1\) hour and \(24\) minutes.

To find the total effective working time of the printer:
\(13\) hours and \(5\) minutes - \(1\) hour and \(24\) minutes = \(11\) hours and \(41\) minutes

Now, we need to calculate how many instructions the printer can print in this effective working time:
\(11\frac{41}{60}\) hours * 100 instructions/hour = \(\frac{701}{6} * 100 = \frac{70100}{6} \approx 11683.333\)

Therefore, the approximate number of instructions printed by the printer is approximately 1168.333.

At an amusement park, tom bought a number of red tokens and green tokens. Each red token costs $0.05, and each green token costs $0.14. If Tom spent a total of exactly $2.06, how many token in total did Tom buy?	"Let the number of red tokens Tom bought be \( x \) and the number of green tokens be \( y \).

The total cost can be represented by the equation:
\[ 0.05x + 0.14y = 2.06 \]

Given that the total cost is $2.06, we need to find integer values for \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy this equation.

To solve this system of equations, we can use trial and error method or substitution method to find suitable values for \( x \) and \( y \).

Let's start with a reasonable value for one of the variables, say let's assume Tom bought all red tokens:
\[ 0.05x = 2.06 \]
\[ x = 2.06 / 0.05 = 41.2\]

Since we cannot have a fraction of a token, let's try another approach by assuming he bought all green tokens:
\[ 0.14y = 2.06\]
\[ y = 2.06 / 0.14 ≈14.\]

Now let's try different combinations until we reach exactly $2.06 spent:

For example,
- If Tom buys all red tokens (41), then he would"
An accurate clock shows 7 o'clock in the morning. The hour hand then rotates by 90o. The time in the clock is:	"To solve this problem, we need to understand that in a 12-hour clock, the hour hand moves 30 degrees every hour. So, for every 90 degrees it moves, it corresponds to a movement of \( \frac{90}{30} = 3 \) hours on the clock.

Given that the clock shows 7 o'clock in the morning and then the hour hand rotates by 90 degrees, we need to calculate how many hours have passed.

Calculating: 
7 o'clock + 3 hours = 10 o'clock

Therefore, after rotating by 90 degrees, the time on the clock is **10 o'clock**.

So, Answer: B)10 o'clock"
If the volume of a tank is 4,120 cubic centimeters, what is the volume of the tank in cubic meters? (1 centimeter = 0.01 meter)	"Given:
Volume of the tank = 4,120 cubic centimeters
1 centimeter = 0.01 meter

To find the volume of the tank in cubic meters, we need to convert cubic centimeters to cubic meters.

Step 1: Convert the volume from cubic centimeters to cubic meters.
Volume in cubic meters = Volume in cubic centimeters * (1 cm^3 / 1000000)
Volume in cubic meters = 4120 * (1/1000000) 
Volume in cubic meters = 0.00412

Therefore, the volume of the tank is 0.00412 cubic meters.

Answer: B) 0.00412"
How many parallelograms will be formed if 7 parallel horizontal lines intersect 6 parallel vertical lines?	"To find the number of parallelograms formed when 7 parallel horizontal lines intersect 6 parallel vertical lines, we can use the formula:

Number of parallelograms = (number of ways to choose 2 horizontal lines) * (number of ways to choose 2 vertical lines)

First, let's calculate the number of ways to choose 2 horizontal lines out of 7. This can be done using combinations which is denoted by ""C(n, r)"" and calculated as n! / [r! * (n-r)!].

Number of ways to choose 2 horizontal lines out of 7:
C(7, 2) = 7! / [2!(7-2)!] = (7*6) / (2*1) = 21

Next, let's calculate the number of ways to choose 2 vertical lines out of 6:
C(6, 2) = 6! / [2!(6-2)!] = (6*5) / (2*1) =15

Now, multiply these two values together to get the total number of parallelograms formed:
Total number of parallelograms = Number of ways to choose 2 horizontal lines * Number of ways to choose

A 5 liter mixture of water and sugar is 50% sugar. If 1 liter of water is added, approximately what is the % of the new mixture of sugar?	"Given:
- Initial mixture: 5 liters, 50% sugar
- After adding 1 liter of water

Let's calculate the initial amount of sugar in the mixture:
Initial sugar content = 50% of 5 liters = (50/100) * 5 = 2.5 liters

After adding 1 liter of water, the total volume becomes:
Total volume = Initial volume + Volume added = 5 + 1 = 6 liters

Since only water was added, the amount of sugar remains at 2.5 liters.

Now, let's find the percentage of sugar in the new mixture:
Percentage of sugar in new mixture = (Amount of sugar / Total volume) * 100
= (2.5 / 6) *100
≈41.67%

Therefore, approximately, the % of the new mixture that is sugar is around A)40%. 

Answer: A)40%"
In a very big class, 40% of the students enrolled for Math and 70% enrolled for Economics. If 15% of the students enrolled for both Math and Economics, what % of the students of the class did not enroll for either of the two subjects?	"Let's solve the question step by step:

Let:
- Total number of students in the class be represented as T
- Number of students enrolled for Math be represented as M
- Number of students enrolled for Economics be represented as E

Given:
- 40% of the students enrolled for Math, which means M = 0.4T
- 70% of the students enrolled for Economics, which means E = 0.7T
- 15% of the students enrolled for both Math and Economics, which means (M ∩ E) = 0.15T

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find out how many students are enrolled in either Math or Economics or both subjects:
Total number of students enrolled in either subject = M + E - (M ∩ E)
Total number of students enrolled in either subject = 0.4T + 0.7T - 0.15T
Total number of students enrolled in either subject = 1.05T - 0.15T
Total number of students enrolled in either subject = 0.9T

Now, we need to find out what percentage did not enroll for either subject:
Number of students who did not enroll for either subject ="
A fisherman's day is rated as good if he catches 9 fishes, fair if he catches 7 fishes and poor if he catches 5 fishes. The fisherman catches 53 fishes in a week that includes good, fair and poor days. How many good days the fisherman had during the week?	"Let's denote the number of good, fair, and poor days as G, F, and P respectively.

From the given information:
1. G + F + P = total number of days in a week = 7
2. 9G + 7F + 5P = total number of fishes caught in a week = 53

We need to find the value of G (number of good days).

Now we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the value of G.

From equation 1: 
G = 7 - F - P

Substitute this into equation 2:
9(7 - F - P) + 7F + 5P = 53
63 - 9F - 9P + 7F + 5P =53
-2F -4P= -10
2F+4P=10
F+2P=5

Since there are only whole numbers for good, fair, and poor days, let's try possible values for F and then calculate corresponding values for P:

If we take F =1,
1+2*P=5 => P=2 which is not valid as it doesn't satisfy the first equation.
If we take F=3"
Some students arranged picnic. The budget was Rs. 240. Because four students of the group failed to go, the cost to each student was increased by Rs.5. How many students went for the picnic?	"Let's denote the original cost per student as x. Since the budget was Rs. 240 and initially there were n students, we have:

Original total cost = x * n

After four students failed to go, the new total cost is (x + 5) * (n - 4), which equals the original budget of Rs. 240:

x * n = (x + 5) * (n - 4)

Expanding this equation gives us:

xn = xn - 4x + 5n - 20

Rearranging terms gives us:

4x = 5n - 20

Now, we know that the total budget was Rs. 240, so:

x * n = Rs.240

Substitute this into our previous equation to get a relationship between x and n:

Rs.240 = xn
Rs.240 = nx
Rs.240 = (5n - 20)n
Rs.240 = 5n^2 -20n
5n^2 -20n- Rs.240=0 

Now solve for 'n' using quadratic formula:
\( n=\frac{-(-20)\pm \sqrt{(-20)^2-4*5*(-Rs.\:240"
A family of 2 parents and 2 children is waiting in line to order at a fast-food restaurant. Joey, the younger child, has a tendency to cause mischief when he is not watched carefully. Because of this, the father wants to keep Joey ahead of him in line at all times. How many different ways can the family arrange themselves in line, such that the father is able to watch Joey?	"To solve this problem, we can consider the positions of Joey and the father in line.

1. If we fix Joey's position in front of the father:
   - There are 2! = 2 ways to arrange the parents.
   - There are 2! = 2 ways to arrange the children.
   So, there are a total of 2 * 2 = 4 ways for this case.

2. If we fix Joey's position behind the father:
   - There is only one way to arrange the parents (father must be ahead).
   - There is only one way to arrange the children (Joey must be behind).
   So, there is a total of 1 * 1 = 1 way for this case.

Therefore, in total, there are 4 + 1 = 5 different ways that satisfy the condition where the father can always watch Joey while waiting in line at all times.

A certain straight corridor has four doors, A, B, C and D (in that order) leading off from the same side. How far apart are doors B and C? The distance between doors B and D is 10 meters. The distance between A and C is 12 meters.	"To find the distance between doors B and C, we can use the information given about the distances between doors.

Let's denote the distance between doors A and B as x meters. Then, the distance between doors B and D is 10 meters, so the total distance from A to D is x + 10 meters.

Similarly, if we denote the distance between doors C and D as y meters, then the total distance from A to D is 12 meters.

Therefore, we have:
Distance from A to D = Distance from A to B + Distance from B to D
x + 10 = 12

Solving for x:
x = 12 - 10
x = 2

Now that we know that the distance between doors A and B is 2 meters, we can find the total distance from door A to C:
Distance from A to C = Distance from A to B + Distance from B to C
Distance from A to C = 2 + y

Given that the total distance from door A to C is 12 meters:
2 + y = 12

Solving for y:
y = 12 - 2
y = 10

Therefore, the distance between doors B and C (which is represented by y"

Akhil has twice as much money as Sohan and Sohan has 50% more money than what Pankaj has. If the average money with them is Rs 110, then Akhil has	"Let's denote the amount of money Pankaj has as x.

According to the given information:
- Sohan has 50% more money than Pankaj, so Sohan has x + 0.5x = 1.5x.
- Akhil has twice as much money as Sohan, so Akhil has 2 * 1.5x = 3x.

The total amount of money they have is the sum of their individual amounts divided by the number of people (which is 3 in this case) and it equals Rs 110:
(x + 1.5x + 3x) / 3 = Rs 110
(5.5x) / 3 = Rs 110
5.5x = Rs330
x = Rs60

So, Akhil has:

A password to a certain database consists of digits that cannot be repeated. If the password is known to consist of at least 8 digits and it takes 12 seconds to try one combination, what is the amount of time, in minutes, necessary to guarantee access to database?	"To calculate the amount of time necessary to guarantee access to the database, we need to find the total number of possible combinations for an 8-digit password where digits cannot be repeated.

Given that the password consists of at least 8 digits, we will consider all possibilities from an 8-digit password up to a 10-digit password (as it takes 12 seconds to try one combination).

Calculating the total number of combinations:
For an 8-digit password: There are 10 options for the first digit, 9 options for the second digit (as it cannot be repeated), and so on until there are only 3 options left for the last digit.
Total combinations for an 8-digit password = 10 * 9 * ... * 3 = \( \frac{10!}{2!} \)

For a 9-digit password: Similarly, there would be \( \frac{11!}{2!} \) combinations.

For a 10-digit password: There would be \( \frac{12!}{2!} \) combinations.

Adding these up gives us:
\( \frac{10!}{2!} + \frac{11!}{2!} + \frac{12!}{2!} = (\frac{10"
A single refined oil can contains 20% impurities. After double–refining, it contains 4% impurities. How much of double-refined oil can be obtained from 30 litres of single refined oil?	"Given:
- Single refined oil can contains 20% impurities.
- After double-refining, it contains 4% impurities.
- We have 30 litres of single refined oil.

Let's denote the amount of pure oil in the single refined oil can as x litres.

From the information given:
- In the single refined oil can, 80% is pure oil (100% - 20% impurities).
- After double-refining, in the final product, 96% is pure oil (100% - 4% impurities).

Now we set up a proportion to find out how much pure oil is obtained after double-refining:

(80%/100%) * x = (96%/100%) * 30

Solving for x:
0.8x = 0.96 * 30
0.8x = 28.8
x = 28.8 / 0.8
x = 36

So, there are initially 36 litres of pure oil in the single refined can.

After double-refining, all impurities are removed and we get only pure oil:
4/100 * y = (100 -4)/100 *30
0.04y=28.8
y=28"
In an election, 68% of the voters exercised their franchise. Of these, 48% were women. The number of males exercising their franchise was 53,040. How many eligible voters were there in total?	"To find the total number of eligible voters, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of female voters who exercised their franchise:
   68% of the total voters exercised their franchise, and 48% of these were women.
   So, the percentage of female voters who exercised their franchise is: 68% * 48% = 0.68 * 0.48 = 0.3264
   Let x be the total number of voters.
   Therefore, the number of female voters exercising their franchise is: 0.3264x

2. Calculate the number of male voters who exercised their franchise:
   Since we know that there were a total of 53,040 male voters exercising their franchise,
   The number of male voters exercising their franchise is: 53,040

3. Total number of eligible voters:
   Total eligible voters = Number of female voters + Number of male voters
                         = (0.3264x) + (53,040)

Now let's solve for x:

Given that the total percentage sum should be equal to 100%, we have:
68% + (32.64%) = Total percentage
0.68 + 0.3264 = Total percentage
Total percentage = ("
A man invests Rs. 128 and obtained Rs. 16. The interest obtained by him is:	"Given:
Principal amount (P) = Rs. 128
Interest obtained (I) = Rs. 16

We know that the formula to calculate simple interest is:
\[ I = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]

Where:
I = Interest obtained
P = Principal amount
R = Rate of interest
T = Time in years

Substitute the given values into the formula and solve for the rate of interest (R):
\[ 16 = \frac{128 \times R \times 1}{100} \]
\[ 16 = 1.28R \]
\[ R = \frac{16}{1.28} \]
\[ R ≈ 12.5\% \]

Therefore, the rate of interest obtained by him is approximately 12.5%.

Lindsay can paint 25% of a certain room in 20 minutes. What fraction of the same room can Joseph paint in 20 minutes if the two of them can paint the room in an hour, working together at their respective rates?	"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how much of the room Lindsay can paint in 20 minutes. Then, we can determine how much Joseph can paint in the same amount of time.

Given:
- Lindsay can paint 25% of the room in 20 minutes.
- Together, Lindsay and Joseph can paint the room in an hour.

Let's calculate each step:

1. Lindsay paints 25% of the room in 20 minutes:
   - This means she can paint \( \frac{25}{100} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the room.
   - If she paints \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the room in 20 minutes, then she would complete the entire room in \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) minutes.

2. Since together they can complete a whole job (painting a full room) in an hour (60 minutes), and Lindsay alone takes 80 minutes to do it, Joseph must take less time than that.
   
3. Let x be Joseph's painting rate per minute. So his work rate is \( \frac{1}{x} \) fraction per minute.

4. Working together for an hour:

A, B and C start at the same time in the same direction to run around a circular stadium. A completes a round in 252 seconds, B in 308 seconds and c in 198 seconds, all starting at the same point. After what time will they again at the starting point ?	"To find out when A, B, and C will meet again at the starting point, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of their individual times.

Given:
A completes a round in 252 seconds
B completes a round in 308 seconds
C completes a round in 198 seconds

Step 1: Find the LCM of 252, 308, and 198.
Prime factorize each number:
- \(252 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 7\)
- \(308 = 2^2 * 7 * 11\)
- \(198 = 2 *3^2*11\)

The LCM is the product of all prime factors with the highest powers that appear in any one number. So,
LCM = \(2^2 *3^2*7*11\) = \(4*9*7*11\) = \(2772\).

Step 2: Convert this total time into minutes and seconds.
\(2772 \text{ seconds} = \frac{2770}{60}\text{ minutes} + \frac{12}{60}\text{ minutes} =46 \text{ minutes and }12 \text{ seconds}\).

A house sold for $500,000 in 1990 and sold ten years later for $400,000. By what percent did the value of the house change?	"Let's calculate the percentage change in the value of the house:

Step 1: Calculate the absolute change in value:
Absolute Change = Initial Value - Final Value
Absolute Change = $500,000 - $400,000
Absolute Change = $100,000

Step 2: Calculate the percentage change:
Percentage Change = (Absolute Change / Initial Value) * 100%
Percentage Change = ($100,000 / $500,000) * 100%
Percentage Change = 0.20 * 100%
Percentage Change = 20%

Therefore, the value of the house changed by a decrease of 20%.

The distance between Omaha and Lincoln is 60 miles. John drives a car that gets 30 miles per gallon of gas, and David drives a car that gets 20 miles per gallon. How many more gallons of gas does David use on a round trip from Omaha to Lincoln?	"Given:
- Distance between Omaha and Lincoln = 60 miles
- John's car mileage = 30 miles per gallon
- David's car mileage = 20 miles per gallon

To find out how many more gallons of gas David uses on a round trip from Omaha to Lincoln, we can calculate the total gallons used by each person for the round trip.

Let's start with John:
John's car gets 30 miles per gallon. So, for a 60-mile one-way trip, he would need 60/30 = 2 gallons.
For a round trip, John would need 2 * 2 = 4 gallons.

Now let's calculate for David:
David's car gets 20 miles per gallon. So, for a one-way trip of 60 miles, he would need 60/20 =3 gallons.
For a round trip, David would need 3 *2=6 gallons.

Now we find the difference in the amount of gas used by David and John:
David uses (6 -4) =2 more gallons than John on a round trip.

Therefore,

When a number is divided by 6 and then multiplied by 12 and the answer is 9, what is the number?	"Given:
- Let the number be x.
- The process is: (((x / 6) * 12) = 9)

Calculating step by step:
1. Divide the number by 6: x / 6
2. Multiply the result by 12: (x / 6) * 12
3. Set this equal to 9 and solve for x: (x / 6) * 12 = 9

Now, solving for x:
(x / 6) * 12 = 9
=> x * (12/6) = 9
=> x *2 =9
=> x =9/2
=> x=4.5

Therefore, the number is **4.5**.

A, B and C are three contestants in a 1000 m race. If A finishes the race 40 m ahead of B and 64 m ahead of C, how much did each of them cover at that time?	"Let's break down the information given in the question:
- A finishes 40 m ahead of B.
- A finishes 64 m ahead of C.

This means that when B covers x meters, A covers (x + 40) meters and when C covers x meters, A covers (x + 64) meters.

Now, since they all run the same race of 1000m:
- When B covers the full distance (1000m), A would have covered (1000 + 40) = 1040m.
- When C covers the full distance (1000m), A would have covered (1000 + 64) = 1064m.

Therefore, to find out how much each has covered at a specific point in time:
- For option A: When B covers 890m, C would cover (890 - 64) = 826m. This is not correct.
- For option B: When B covers 860m, C would cover (860 - 64) =796m. This is not correct.
- For option C: When B covers 930m, C would cover (930 -64) =866 m. This matches our calculation for when they finish the race. So this is our"
At a delivery store, seven packages have an average (arithmetic mean) weight of 222 kg and a median weight of 270 kg. What is the maximum possible weight, in kilograms, of the lightest package?	"Given:
- The average weight of 7 packages is 222 kg.
- The median weight of the packages is 270 kg.

To find the maximum possible weight of the lightest package, we need to consider the distribution of weights in such a way that the median is maximized while keeping the average constant. 

Let's assume that there are four packages with weights less than or equal to 222 kg and three packages with weights greater than or equal to 222 kg. Since there are seven packages in total, this arrangement will ensure that the median weight is at position (7 + 1) / 2 = 4th place.

Since the median weight is given as 270 kg, it means that the fourth package has a weight of 270 kg. This implies that three packages have weights less than or equal to 222 kg and three have weights greater than or equal to 270 kg.

Now, let's calculate:
Total weight of all seven packages = Average * Number of Packages
Total weight = 222 * 7 = 1554 kg

For three lighter packages: Total Weight <= (3 * Maximum Possible Weight)
For three heavier packages: Total Weight >= (3 * Minimum Possible Weight)

Let x be the maximum possible weight for each lighter"
In 4 years, Raj's father will be double Raj's age then. Two years ago, while his mother was twice his age that time. If Raj is going to be 32 years old 8 years from now, then what is the sum of his parents age now?	"Let's denote Raj's current age as R, his father's current age as F, and his mother's current age as M.

From the given information:
1. In 4 years, Raj will be 32 years old (8 years from now), so currently he is 32 - 8 = 24 years old.
   Therefore, R = 24.

2. In 4 years, Raj's father will be double Raj's age then:
   F + 4 = 2*(R + 4)
   F + 4 = 2*(24 + 4)
   F + 4 = 2*28
   F + 4 =56
   F =56 -4

In 1989 the price of a new model S car was x dollars. If the price of the model S car increased each year by 10 percent of the previous year's price, what was the price of the car, in dollars, in 1991?	"To find the price of the car in 1991, we need to calculate the price after two years from 1989.

Let's denote the initial price of the car in 1989 as x dollars.

In 1990, the price would increase by 10%: 
Price in 1990 = x + (10/100)*x = x + 0.1x = 1.1x dollars

Now, in 1991, the price would increase by another 10% based on the previous year's price (1.1x):
Price in 1991 = 1.1x + (10/100)*(1.1x) = 1.21x dollars

Therefore, the price of the car in dollars in 1991 was $1.21x.

Answer: C) $1.21x"

Divide the number 49 into two parts, such that if the greater part is increased by 6 and the lesser part is decreased by 11, their ratio is 9 to 2.	"Given:
Let the greater part be x and the lesser part be y.
According to the question, we have two equations:
1. x + y = 49 (as the number is divided into two parts)
2. (x + 6)/(y - 11) = 9/2 (the ratio of increased greater part to decreased lesser part)

Solving equation 1 for x, we get: x = 49 - y
Substitute this value of x into equation 2:
(49 - y + 6)/(y - 11) = 9/2
(55 - y)/(y - 11) = 9/2
Cross multiply to solve for y:
2(55 - y) = 9(y -11)
110 - 2y = 9y -99
110 +99=11y
209=11y
y=19

Now substitute back to find x:
x=49-19
x=30

Therefore, the two parts are: 
Greater part (x) =30 
Lesser part (y)=19

A Doctor must see 35 patients in a day. At 4 PM the doctor had seen 21 of his patients. What percentage of patients had he not seen ?	"To find out what percentage of patients the doctor had not seen by 4 PM, we first need to calculate how many patients he still needs to see.

Total patients the doctor must see in a day = 35
Patients seen by 4 PM = 21

Patients not seen = Total patients - Patients seen
Patients not seen = 35 - 21
Patients not seen = 14

Now, to find the percentage of patients he had not seen:
Percentage of patients not seen = (Patients not seen / Total patients) * 100%
Percentage of patients not seen = (14 / 35) * 100%
Percentage of patients not seen ≈ 40%

Therefore, the answer is:

Jay is selling his shoes and making a 15% gain from it. His friend wants to buy them so he offers him a 5% discount. At what price did Jay originally buy his shoes, if he sold it to his friend for $218.50?	"To find the original price at which Jay bought his shoes, we can work backwards from the selling price after considering both the gain and discount.

Let x be the original price of the shoes.

1. Jay makes a 15% gain on the original price:
Selling Price = Original Price + Gain
218.50 = x + 0.15x
218.50 = 1.15x

2. His friend offers a 5% discount on this selling price:
Discounted Price = Selling Price - Discount
Discounted Price = 218.50 - 0.05(218.50)
Discounted Price = 218.50 - 10.925
Discounted Price = $207.575

Now, we know that this discounted price is equal to what Jay originally paid for the shoes:
207.575 = 1.15x
Dividing by 1.15 on both sides gives:
x ≈ $180

Therefore, Jay originally bought his shoes for around $180.

Gina and Tina's average grade is 23 points higher than Tina's grade. What is the difference between their grades?	"To find the difference between Gina and Tina's grades, we first need to set up an equation based on the given information.

Let Tina's grade be represented by T. Since Gina and Tina's average grade is 23 points higher than Tina's grade, Gina and Tina's average grade can be represented as (T + 23).

The average of two numbers is calculated by adding them together and dividing by 2. So we have:

(T + (T + 23)) / 2 = T + 23

Solving this equation will give us Tina's actual grade.

2T + 23 = 2(T + 23)
2T + 23 = 2T + 46
Subtracting both sides by T:
T = 46

Now that we know Tina's actual grade is 46, we can find Gina's grade which is (46+23) =69.

The difference between their grades would be:
Gina's Grade - Tina's Grade
69 - 46 =

Of a certain high school graduating class, 25 percent of the students continued their formal education, and 50 percent of those who continued their formal education went to four-year colleges. If 100 students in the class went to four-year colleges, how many students were in the graduating class?	"Let's denote the total number of students in the graduating class as \( x \).

Given:
- 25% of the students continued their formal education, which means 0.25\(x\) students continued their education.
- 50% of those who continued their formal education went to four-year colleges, which means 0.5 * 0.25\(x\) = 100 students went to four-year colleges.

From the second statement, we have:
\[0.5 * 0.25x = 100\]
\[0.125x = 100\]
\[x = \frac{100}{0.125}\]
\[x = 800\]

A cycled from P to Q at 10 kmph and returned at the rate of 9 kmph. B cycled both ways at 12 kmph. In the whole journey B took 10 minutes less than A. Find the distance between P and Q.	"Given:
Speed of A while going from P to Q = 10 km/hr
Speed of A while returning from Q to P = 9 km/hr
Speed of B for the entire journey = 12 km/hr

Let the distance between P and Q be D kilometers.

Time taken by A to go from P to Q: D/10 hours
Time taken by A to return from Q to P: D/9 hours
Total time taken by A: D/10 + D/9 hours

Time taken by B for the whole journey: D/12 hours

Given that B took 10 minutes less than A:
D/12 = D/10 + D/9 - 10 minutes
Converting 10 minutes into hours, we get it as 1/6 hour.

Now, solving the equation:
D/12 = (9D + 10D)/(90) - (15)/90
D/12 = (19D -15)/90
90D = 1440D -180 
1350D=180 
D=180 /1350 
Therefore, Distance between P and Q is \( \frac{180}{1350} \) kilometers which simplifies to \( \frac{4}{30} \"
If a rectangular box has two faces with an area of 25, two faces of area 50, and two faces of area 72, what is its volume?	"To find the volume of the rectangular box, we need to determine the length, width, and height of the box using the given areas of its faces.

Let's denote:
- Area of one face as x
- Area of another face as y
- Area of the remaining two faces as z

Given:
x = 25,
y = 50,
z = 72

The area of a face of a rectangular box is equal to the product of its length and width. So, we can express x, y, and z in terms of length (l) and width (w) as follows:
x = lw
y = lw
z = lh or wh

From this information, we can deduce that:
l * w = 25   ...(1)
l * w = 50   ...(2)
l * h or w * h= 72   ...(3)

Solving equations (1) and (2), we get l=w=5.

Substitute l=w=5 into equation (3):
5 * h or 5*h=72
h=72/5 
h=14.4

Therefore, the volume V=l*w*h=(5)*(5)*(14.4)=360 cubic units.

A scooter and a television cost ratio is 8:7. If cost of scooter is 4000 rs. more than television. Then, calculate the cost of television?	"Let's denote the cost of the television as \( x \) rupees. 

Given that the ratio of the cost of scooter to television is 8:7, we can write this as:
\[ \frac{\text{Cost of Scooter}}{\text{Cost of Television}} = \frac{8}{7} \]

We are also given that the cost of scooter is 4000 rupees more than the television:
\[ \text{Cost of Scooter} = x + 4000 \]

Now, we can set up an equation using the information above:
\[ \frac{x + 4000}{x} = \frac{8}{7} \]

Cross multiplying gives:
\[ 7(x + 4000) = 8x \]

In the reading room of a library, there are 10 tables, 4 chairs per table. In each table there are different numbers of people seated. How many ways they will sit in the library so that no chair would be blank?	"To solve this problem, we can consider the number of ways people can be seated at each table without leaving any chair blank.

Given:
- 10 tables
- 4 chairs per table

Since there are different numbers of people seated at each table, we need to find the number of ways they will sit so that no chair would be blank.

Let's start by considering each table separately:

Table 1: 
- Number of ways to seat people at Table 1 without leaving any chair blank = 4! (as there are 4 chairs and different numbers of people)

Similarly, for Tables 2 to 10:
- Number of ways to seat people at each subsequent table without leaving any chair blank = 4!

Now, since these events are independent (the arrangement at one table does not affect the arrangement at another), we multiply the number of ways for each table:

Total number of ways = (4!)^10

Calculating this gives us:
Total number of ways = (24)^10
Total number of ways = 282,429,536,481

Therefore, there are a total of **282,429,536,481** ways they can sit in the library so that no chair would be blank.

An engine of length 1000 m moving at 10 m/s. A bird is flying from the start of the engine to the end at x kmph and coming back at 2x. Take total time of bird traveling as 187.5 seconds. Find x and 2x	"Given:
- Length of the engine = 1000 m
- Speed of the engine = 10 m/s
- Speed of bird flying from start to end = x kmph
- Speed of bird flying back from end to start = 2x kmph
- Total time for bird traveling in both directions = 187.5 seconds

Let's first convert all speeds to m/s as it is a standard unit for speed.

1 km/h = (1000/3600) m/s
So, x km/h = x*(1000/3600) m/s and 2x km/h = 2x*(1000/3600) m/s

Total distance covered by the bird in one round trip (from start to end and back) is equal to the length of the engine:
Distance = 1000 meters

Let's calculate the time taken by the bird in each direction using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

For first trip (start to end):
Time taken = Distance / Speed 
Time taken for this leg of journey is given as t1.

For second trip (end to start):
Time taken for this leg will be twice that on first leg.
Time taken for this leg is given as t2.

Consider a courier company A which can deliver 100 parcels in 5 days with 5 men working for 8 hours a day. Consider another courier company B where every employee is equally efficient as that of company B. Company B is short of one man when compared to A and has a policy of asking its workers to work only for 6 hours a day. How long (in days) company B will take to deliver 100 parcels.	"Let's first find the total work hours required by company A to deliver 100 parcels.

Total work hours for company A = 5 days * 5 men * 8 hours/day = 200 man-hours

Now, let's find the efficiency ratio of company B compared to company A. Since each employee in company B is equally efficient as that of company A and there is one less person working in company B:

Efficiency ratio = (Number of men in Company A) / (Number of men in Company B)
Efficiency ratio = 5 / (5 - 1) = 5/4

Since the workers in Company B only work for 6 hours a day:
Effective work hours per day for Company B = Number of men * Hours worked per day
Effective work hours per day for Company B = 4 men * 6 hours/day = 24 man-hours/day

Now, let's calculate how many days it will take for Company B to deliver the same workload as Company A:

Days required for Company B = Total work hours / Effective work hours per day
Days required for Company B = 200 man-hours / 24 man-hours/day ≈ **8.33 days**

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer: **B)8"

Davji Shop sells samosas in boxes of different sizes. The samosas are priced at Rs. 2 per samosa up to 200 samosas. For every additional 20 samosas, the price of the whole lot goes down by 10 paise per samosa. What should be the maximum size of the box that would maximise the revenue?	"To maximize revenue, we need to find the optimal box size that generates the highest revenue. 

Let's analyze the pricing structure:
- For the first 200 samosas, each samosa is priced at Rs. 2.
- For every additional 20 samosas beyond 200, the price per samosa decreases by 10 paise (0.10 Rs).

Let x be the number of additional sets of 20 samosas beyond the initial 200.

The revenue generated from selling x sets of additional 20 samosas can be calculated as follows:
Revenue = (Price per samosa for first 200) * (Number of samosas in first 200) + 
          (Price per samosa for additional sets) * (Number of additional sets * Number of samosas in each set)

Revenue = (2 Rs/samosa) * (200) + ((2 - x*0.10) Rs/samosa) * (x*20)

Now, we need to find the value of x that maximizes this revenue function.

To do this, let's expand and simplify our expression for Revenue:
Revenue = 400 + (40x - 0.10x^2)
Revenue = -0.10x^2 + "

Rationale: 
Let's denote the age of the mother as M and the age of the son as S.
According to the given information, we have:
M/S = 3/5   (the ratio of their ages)
Given that M (mother's age) = 12 years.

Now, substitute M = 12 into our ratio equation:
12/S = 3/5

Cross multiply to solve for S:
5 * 12 = 3 * S
60 = 3S
S = 60 / 3
S =20

Therefore, the age of the son is calculated to be S=20 years.

What is the interest due after 40 days for Rs. 3200 at 10% interest per year?	"Given:
Principal amount (P) = Rs. 3200
Rate of interest (R) = 10% per year
Time period (T) = 40 days

We need to find the interest due after 40 days.

First, we calculate the interest for one year using the formula:
Simple Interest (SI) = (P * R * T)/100

Since the time period is given in days, we need to convert it into years. There are usually 365 days in a year, so:
1 year = 365 days
Therefore, for converting 40 days into years:
T(years) = 40/365

Now, we can calculate the interest for one year and then adjust it for the actual time period of 40 days.

Let's calculate step by step:

Step 1: Convert time into years
T(years) = 40/365 ≈ 0.1096 years

Step 2: Calculate simple interest for one year
SI = (3200 * 10 * 0.1096)/100 ≈ Rs.35.07

Therefore, the interest due after 40 days for Rs.3200 at a rate of interest of 10% per year is approximately Rs.35"
A bakery has 4 varieties of pastries. Each variety is having many number of pastry. I want to purchase of 10 pastries such that I get to taste each variety. How many ways to purchase?	"To find the number of ways to purchase 10 pastries such that you get to taste each variety, we can use the concept of distributing identical objects into distinct boxes.

Since there are 4 varieties of pastries and you want to purchase 10 pastries in total, you can think of this problem as distributing 10 identical pastries into 4 distinct boxes (one for each variety).

This is a classic stars and bars problem. The formula for distributing identical objects into distinct boxes is (n + r - 1) choose (r - 1), where n is the number of objects and r is the number of boxes.

In this case, n = 10 (number of pastries) and r = 4 (number of varieties). So, the number of ways to purchase 10 pastries such that you get to taste each variety is calculated as:

(10 + 4 - 1) choose (4 - 1) = 13 choose 3 = C(13,3) = (13 *12 *11)/(3*2*1) =1560/6=260

Therefore, there are a total of **260** ways to purchase the pastries.

So, **Answer: E)91**"

One side of a rectangular field is 4 m and its length along diagonal is 5 m. What is the area of the field?	"Given that one side of the rectangular field is 4 m and its length along the diagonal is 5 m, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the other side of the rectangle.

Let's denote one side of the rectangle as x. According to the Pythagorean theorem, in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (diagonal) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, we have:

\(4^2 + x^2 = 5^2\)

Solving for x:
\(16 + x^2 = 25\)
\(x^2 = 25 - 16\)
\(x^2 = 9\)
\(x = \sqrt{9}\)
\(x = 3\) 

So, the other side of the rectangle is 3 m.

Now, we can calculate the area of a rectangle using its sides:
Area = Length * Width
Area = 4m * 3m
Area = \(12 m^2\)

In 1978, a kg of paper was sold at Rs25/-. If the paper rate increases at 1.5% more than the inflation rate which is 6.5% a year, then what will be the cost of a kg of paper after 2 years?	"To find the cost of a kg of paper after 2 years with the given conditions, we can calculate it step by step:

1. Calculate the new price after 1 year:
   - Inflation rate: 6.5%
   - Paper rate increase: 6.5% + 1.5% = 8%
   - Increase in price after one year: Rs25 * (8/100) = Rs2
   - New price after one year: Rs25 + Rs2 = Rs27

2. Calculate the new price after another year:
   - Increase in price for the second year at the same rate of 8%: Rs27 * (8/100) = Rs2.16
   - Cost of a kg of paper after two years: Rs27 + Rs2.16 = Rs29.16

Therefore, the cost of a kg of paper after 2 years will be Rs29.16.

Find the cost of carpeting a room 13 m long and 9 m broad with a carpet 75 cm wide at the rate of Rs. 12.40 per square metre.	"Given:
Length of the room = 13 m
Breadth of the room = 9 m
Width of the carpet = 75 cm = 0.75 m (as 1 m = 100 cm)
Rate of carpeting per square meter = Rs. 12.40

To find the cost of carpeting the room, we need to calculate the area covered by the carpet.

Area covered by one strip of carpet along the length = Length * Width_of_carpet
Area covered by one strip of carpet along the breadth = Breadth * Width_of_carpet

Total area covered by one strip along length and one strip along breadth:
= Length * Width_of_carpet + Breadth * Width_of_carpet
= (13 * 0.75) + (9 * 0.75)
= (9.75) + (6.75)
=16.5 sq.m

Now, total cost for covering this area with a rate of Rs.12.40 per square meter:
Total cost = Total area * Rate_per_sq.m
Total cost = 16.5 sq.m * Rs.12.40/sq.m
Total cost = Rs.(16.5*12.40)

The ratio of a numerator to denominator is 2:3. If six is subtracted from the numerator, the new fraction is now 2/3 of the original fraction. Find the numerator.'	"To solve this question step by step, let's denote the numerator as \(2x\) and the denominator as \(3x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer.

Given that the ratio of the numerator to the denominator is 2:3, we have:
\[\frac{2x}{3x} = \frac{2}{3}\]

Now, it is given that when six is subtracted from the numerator, the new fraction becomes 2/3 of the original fraction. So we can set up an equation based on this information:

\[\frac{2x - 6}{3x} = \frac{2}{3}\]

Now, we can solve for x by cross multiplying in both equations:

From \(\frac{2x}{3x} = \frac{2}{3}\):
\[6(2x) = 3(2)\]
\[12x = 6\]
\[x = \frac{6}{12}\]

Beth: \If you two add your numbers, we get my birthday this month, which was before today.""
Caitlin: \If you two add your numbers, we get my birthday this month, which is after today.""
What number did Caitlin get?"	"To find Caitlin's number, we need to consider the clues given by Ashley, Beth, and Caitlin.

Let's denote the numbers A, B, and C as two-digit prime numbers given to Ashley, Beth, and Caitlin respectively.

From Ashley's statement: A + B = today's date
From Beth's statement: A + B = Beth's birthday (before today)
From Caitlin's statement: A + B = Caitlin's birthday (after today)

John spent 72% of his budget on fruits ( including apples) , and 36% of his budget on apples. What percent of the money spent on Fruits were not spent on apples.	"Given:
- John spent 72% of his budget on fruits (including apples).
- John spent 36% of his budget on apples.

Let's assume John's total budget is $100 for easier calculations.

1. Amount spent on fruits = 72% of $100 = $72
2. Amount spent on apples = 36% of $100 = $36

Now, we need to find the amount that was spent on fruits but not on apples.
This can be calculated by subtracting the amount spent on apples from the total amount spent on fruits.

Amount not spent on apples = Amount spent on fruits - Amount spent on apples
Amount not spent on apples = $72 - $36
Amount not spent on apples = $36

Now, let's find the percentage of money that was not spent on apples out of the money that was initially used for fruits:

Percentage not spent on apples out of money used for fruits = (Amount not spend / Total amount) * 100%
Percentage not spend out of money used for fruits= ($36 /$72) * 100%
Percentage not spend out of money used for fruits= 50%

Therefore, the answer is:

In a group of 18 children, there are twice as many girls as boys, and twice as many right-handed people as there are left-handed people. If a sixth of the boys are left-handed, how many girls are right-handed?	"Let's break down the information given in the question:

1. In a group of 18 children, there are twice as many girls as boys.
2. There are twice as many right-handed people as there are left-handed people.
3. A sixth of the boys are left-handed.

Let's denote:
- Let the number of boys be B
- The number of girls would be 2B (twice as many girls as boys)
- Let L represent the number of left-handed children
- The number of right-handed children would be 2L (twice as many right-handed people)

From the first statement, we know that B + 2B = 18 (total number of children)
This simplifies to 3B = 18, which gives us B = 6

Since a sixth of the boys are left-handed and there are six boys, then there is one left-handed boy (1/6 * 6 = 1).

Now we know:
Boys (B) = 6
Girls = 2 * Boys = 12
Left-handed children (L) = Left-handed Boys + Left-handed Girls = 1 + Left-handed Girls
Right-handed children = Total Children - Left Handed Children

A farmer is trying to grow the largest pumpkin for the county fair. He estimates that in one month he will grow his current largest pumpkin by 35 percent. A traveling salesman offers him a plant fertilizer that is guaranteed to help grow the pumpkin an additional 5 percent. If the salesman's product works, what is the total percentage increases the farmer will achieve with his pumpkin in one month.	"To find the total percentage increase in the size of the pumpkin after one month, we need to consider both increases separately and then add them up.

Let's denote:
- The initial increase by 35% as Increase A
- The additional increase by 5% as Increase B

Increase A = 35%
Increase B = 5%

To calculate the total percentage increase, we use the formula for successive percentage increases:

Total Percentage Increase = 100% + Increase A + (100% * Increase B) / 100%

Plugging in the values:
Total Percentage Increase = 100% + 35% + (100% * 5%) / 100%
Total Percentage Increase = 100% + 35% + (5%) 
Total Percentage Increase = 135% + 5%
Total Percentage Increase = 140%

Therefore, the total percentage increase that the farmer will achieve with his pumpkin in one month is:

Company X receives 16 applications for a job, 6 of which are from present employees of the company. If 3 of the applicants are to be hired, including exactly one of the applicants who is not a present employee of the company, how many distinct groups of applicants can be selected?	"Given:
Total applications = 16
Applications from present employees = 6
Applicants to be hired = 3

To find the number of distinct groups of applicants that can be selected, including exactly one applicant who is not a present employee, we need to consider the following cases:

Case 1: Selecting 1 applicant who is not a present employee and 2 applicants who are present employees.
Number of ways to select 1 non-present employee out of (16 - 6) = 10 applicants = C(10,1)
Number of ways to select 2 present employees out of the remaining present employees (6) = C(6,2)

Total ways for Case 1 = C(10,1) * C(6,2)

Case 2: Selecting all three applicants from present employees.
Number of ways to select all three from the present employees (6) = C(6,3)

Total ways for Case 2 = C(6,3)

Total distinct groups of applicants that can be selected:

The measures of the interior angles taken in order of a polygon form an arithmetic sequence. The least measurement in the sequence is 850. The greatest measurement is 2150. Find the number of sides in the given polygon	"To find the number of sides in the polygon, we first need to determine the common difference of the arithmetic sequence formed by the interior angles.

Given that the least measurement is 850 and the greatest measurement is 2150, we can use these values to find the common difference:
Common difference = (Greatest angle - Least angle) / (n-1), where n is the number of sides

Substitute in the values:
Common difference = (2150 - 850) / (n-1)
Common difference = 1300 / (n-1)

We also know that for an arithmetic sequence, the average of all terms is equal to each term. So, we can find this average as follows:
Average angle = (Least angle + Greatest angle) / 2
Average angle = (850 + 2150) / 2
Average angle = 1500

Since each term in an arithmetic sequence represents an interior angle of a polygon, and their sum equals to total degrees in a polygon which can be calculated using: 
Total degrees in a polygon with n sides = (n * Average Angle)

Now let's equate this sum with what it should be if they form an arithmetic series with common differences as found earlier:

An oculist charges $30.00 for an eye examination, frames, and glass lenses, but $48.00 for an eye examination, frames, and plastic lenses. If the plastic lenses cost four times as much as the glass lenses, how much do the glass lenses cost?	"Let's denote the cost of the glass lenses as x. 

From the given information, we know that:
For glass lenses: Eye examination + frames + glass lenses = $30.00
For plastic lenses: Eye examination + frames + plastic lenses = $48.00

Since the plastic lenses cost four times as much as the glass lenses, we can express this relationship as:
4x (cost of plastic lenses) = x (cost of glass lenses)

Now, let's substitute these values into the equations:

1. For glass lenses:
Eye examination + frames + x = $30.00

2. For plastic lenses:
Eye examination + frames + 4x = $48.00

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2 gives us:
3x = $18.00
x = $6.00

Therefore, the cost of the glass lenses is $6.

2. After increasing the price, the new revenue would be \( (250 + 40)(x - 400) \) because there are 400 fewer subscribers.
3. Since it's mentioned that the revenue remains the same before and after, we can set up an equation:
   \[ 250x = (250 + 40)(x - 400) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 250x = (290)(x - 400) \]
\[ 250x = 290x -116000 \]
\[ 40x =116000\]
\[ x =2900\]

Therefore, there were originally \(2900\) subscribers last year.

A picks a number from the bag where the bag consists of numbers from {1,2....23} and puts it in the same bag. Now, another person B picks a number from the bag. Find the probability that A has picked a greater number than B?	"To find the probability that A has picked a greater number than B, we need to consider all possible pairs of numbers that A and B can pick.

Total number of outcomes when A and B pick numbers from {1, 2, ..., 23} is 23 * 23 = 529 (since each person can pick any number from the bag).

Now let's consider the cases where A picks a greater number than B:
- If A picks 2, there are 21 numbers less than or equal to 2. So, there are 21 possibilities for B to pick a smaller number.
- If A picks 3, there are 22 numbers less than or equal to 3. So, there are 22 possibilities for B to pick a smaller number.
- ...
- If A picks 23, there are no numbers less than or equal to it. So, there are no possibilities for B to pick a smaller number.

Therefore, the total favorable outcomes where A has picked a greater number than B is: 
(21 + 22 + ... + 0) = (21*22)/2 =231

So the probability that A has picked a greater number than B is: 
Favorable outcomes / Total outcomes =231 /529"
Ram has 12 pennies. He lost 5 of his pennies, how many does he have now?	"Let's solve the question step by step:

Ram has 12 pennies.
He lost 5 of his pennies.

To find out how many pennies Ram has now, we need to subtract the number of lost pennies from the initial number of pennies.

Initial number of pennies = 12
Number of lost pennies = 5

Number of pennies Ram has now = Initial number - Number lost
Number of pennies Ram has now = 12 - 5
Number of pennies Ram has now = 7

Therefore, Ram has 7 pennies now.

A green lizard can travel from the green cave to the blue cave in 72 minutes; the blue lizard can travel from the blue cave to the green cave in 25% less time. If the green lizard started to travel 5.5 minutes before the blue lizard, how many minutes after the blue lizard, will the green lizard pass the middle line?	"Given:
- Time taken by the green lizard to travel from the green cave to the blue cave = 72 minutes
- The blue lizard can travel from the blue cave to the green cave in 25% less time, which means it takes \(0.75 \times 72 = 54\) minutes for the blue lizard to travel from blue to green.
- The green lizard started traveling 5.5 minutes before the blue lizard.

Let's calculate when they will meet:
Let x be the time after the blue lizard starts that they meet at the middle line.

The distance traveled by both lizards when they meet is equal, as they are meeting at a point.
Distance = Speed * Time

For Green Lizard:
Speed of Green Lizard = Distance / Time
Speed of Green Lizard = Distance (from Green Cave to Blue Cave) / 72

For Blue Lizard:
Speed of Blue Lizard = Distance / Time
Speed of Blue Lizard = Distance (from Blue Cave to Green Cave) / x

Since both lizards cover equal distances when they meet:
Distance (Green) = Speed (Green) * Total time taken by Green
Distance (Blue) = Speed (Blue) * Total time taken by Blue

Let x be the original amount of the electricity bill.

Given:
- Reduction for paying before due date is 4%.
- Actual reduction received is 13.

So, according to the given information:
0.04x = 13

Now, solve for x:
x = 13 / 0.04
x = $325

Therefore, the original amount of his electricity bill was $325.

How many hand shakes will be there, if 8 people shake hands with every other person in the room?	"To find the total number of handshakes when 8 people shake hands with every other person in the room, we can use the combination formula.

Step 1: Determine the total number of ways to choose 2 people out of 8 for a handshake.
This is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of people and k is the number of people chosen for a handshake.
In this case, n = 8 and k = 2.
C(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!) = (8*7) / (2*1) = 28

Step 2: Calculate the total number of handshakes.
Since each handshake involves two people, we need to multiply C(8, 2) by 2 to get the total number of handshakes.
Total handshakes = C(8, 2) * 2
Total handshakes = 28 * 2
Total handshakes = 56

Therefore, there will be a total of **56** handshakes in this scenario.

G and H are each equal to 20% of Z. If G, H, and F are equal to 100% of Z together, what percentage of Z is F?	"Given:
G and H are each equal to 20% of Z.
G + H + F = 100% of Z

Let's represent the above information mathematically:
G = 0.2Z
H = 0.2Z
G + H + F = Z

Substitute the values of G and H into the third equation:
0.2Z + 0.2Z + F = Z
0.4Z + F = Z
F = Z - 0.4Z
F = 0.6Z

So, F is equal to 60% of Z.

When Mary paints a house, it takes her 4 hours. When Lisa joins Mary, and they work together, it takes them only 3 hours to paint a house of the same size. How long would it take for Lisa to paint a house of the same size by herself?	"Let's denote Mary's painting rate as \(M\) (houses per hour) and Lisa's painting rate as \(L\) (houses per hour).

From the given information:
- Mary can paint 1 house in 4 hours, so her rate is \(M = \frac{1}{4}\) houses per hour.
- When Mary and Lisa work together, they can paint 1 house in 3 hours, so their combined rate is \(\frac{1}{3}\) houses per hour.

When working together, their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates:
\[ M + L = \frac{1}{3} \]

We already know that \(M = \frac{1}{4}\), so we can substitute this into the equation above to find Lisa's painting rate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + L = \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ L = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{4 - 3}{12} = \frac{1}{12} \]

Therefore, Lisa can paint a house by herself at a rate of \(L =\frac {1 } {12}\) houses per hour. To find out how long"
Consider a school which consists of boys, girls and one teacher. There twice as many girls as boys. During prayer, this school follows a procedure where people bows to each other. Each girl and boy is required to bow to other girls, boys and their teacher. Each day 900 bows are completed. Find how many boys there are in the school ?	"Let's denote the number of boys in the school as B. Since there are twice as many girls as boys, the number of girls would be 2B.

Each boy bows to other boys, girls, and the teacher. So each boy makes 2B + 2 + 1 = 2B + 3 bows.
Each girl also bows to other girls, boys, and the teacher. So each girl makes B + 2 + 1 = B + 3 bows.

Given that each day a total of 900 bows are completed:
Total number of bows made by boys per day = Number of boys * (bows per boy) = B * (2B + 3)
Total number of bows made by girls per day = Number of girls * (bows per girl) = (2B) * (B + 3)

Since the total number of bows completed is given as 900:
B * (2B + 3) + (2B) * (B + 3) =900
Solving this equation will give us the value for B which represents the number of boys in the school.

Now we can calculate and find how many boys there are in the school."
"I have an amazing bath tub having both hot and cold water taps.
The cold water tap can fill my tub in 6 hours while cold water tap can fill the tub in approximately 4 hours.
I turned them on simultaneously but forgot to close the lid which removes the water out of tub.
The lid can empty the tub in exact 13 hours.
Since both taps are open along with the lib, can you estimate the time needed to fill the bath tub?"	"Let's denote the rate at which the hot water tap fills the tub as H (in tubs per hour) and the rate at which the cold water tap fills the tub as C (in tubs per hour).

From the given information:
- The hot water tap can fill the tub in 4 hours, so its rate is H = 1/4.
- The cold water tap can fill the tub in 6 hours, so its rate is C = 1/6.
- The lid can empty the tub in 13 hours, so it has a negative rate of -1/13.

When both taps are open along with the lid, their rates add up:
Combined filling rate = H + C - |lid emptying rate| = H + C + 1/13

Now we need to find how long it takes to fill one bathtub when both taps are open along with the lid. Let's denote this time as T.

The amount filled by both taps and emptied by the lid in time T should be equal to one full bath:
T * (H + C + 1/13) = 1

Substitute H = 1/4 and C = 1/6 into above equation and solve for T:

A man had 43 sheep. he wanted to divide them equally among his 6 children. How many sheep shall he keep to himself, so as to equally divide remaining sheep among his 6 children?	"To divide 43 sheep equally among 6 children, each child would ideally get \( \frac{43}{6} \) sheep. 

Calculating this, we find that each child should get approximately 7.16 sheep.

Since the man cannot give a fraction of a sheep to each child, he needs to keep some sheep for himself so that the remaining whole number of sheep can be divided equally among his children.

To find out how many sheep he should keep for himself, we need to find the remainder when 43 is divided by 6:

\[ 43 \div 6 = 7 \text{ with a remainder of } 1 \]

So, if he keeps one sheep for himself, then he can equally divide the remaining 42 sheep (43 - 1) among his six children.

Therefore, the man should keep \( \boxed{\text{(D) }2} \) sheep to himself in order to equally divide the remaining sheep among his six children."
If a jewelry store wants to sell a necklace for $179.95 next week at a 50% off sale, how much is the price of the necklace this week?	"Given:
Sale price = $179.95
Discount = 50%

Let x be the original price of the necklace.

The sale price is calculated as:
Sale price = Original price - Discount amount
$179.95 = x - 0.5x
$179.95 = 0.5x

Now, solve for x:
x = $179.95 / 0.5
x = $359.90

Therefore, the original price of the necklace this week is $359.90.

Answer: D) $359.90"
At a company meeting, M men and W women meet in a conference room. If the ratio of men to women is 2:3 at the meeting and the conference room can hold no more than 64 people, then what is the maximum number of women who can be at the meeting?	"Let's denote the number of men as 2x and the number of women as 3x, where x is a positive integer. 

According to the given information, the total number of people at the meeting is M + W = 2x + 3x = 5x.

Since the conference room can hold no more than 64 people, we have:
5x ≤ 64
Dividing by 5 on both sides gives:
x ≤ 12.8

Since x must be a positive integer, the maximum value it can take is x = 12.

Therefore, the maximum number of women at the meeting is:
W = 3 * x = 3 * 12 = 36

So, Answer: B)36"
A password needs to contain 2 letters and 3 numbers. How many different passwords are possible if repetition of letters and numbers is allowed?	"To find the total number of different passwords possible with 2 letters and 3 numbers, where repetition is allowed, we can calculate it step by step:

1. There are 26 letters in the English alphabet (from A to Z).
2. There are 10 digits (0 to 9).

For the password:
- The first letter can be any of the 26 letters.
- The second letter can also be any of the 26 letters.
- The first number can be any of the 10 digits.
- The second number can also be any of the 10 digits.
- The third number can again be any of the 10 digits.

Therefore, using the multiplication principle for counting combinations, we multiply these possibilities together to get the total number of different passwords:

Total = (Number of choices for each position) ^ (Number of positions)

Total = 26 * 26 * 10 * 10 * 10
Total = 676000

Therefore, there are a total of **676000** different passwords possible if repetition is allowed.
