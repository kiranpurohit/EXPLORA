The tickets cost $20.00, the candy is $5.00 and the combo will is $11.00 so Connor will spend 20+5+11 = $<<20+5+11=36.00>>36.00 during his date

He's also going to buy several sides that will weigh half the amount of hot dogs.  How many pounds of food will he buy?","He is buying 16 pounds of chicken and half that amount in hamburgers so he's buying 16/2 = <<16/2=8>>8 pounds of hamburgers
He's going to buy 2 more pounds of hotdogs than hamburgers, which are 8 pounds so he'll have 2+8 = <<2+8=10>>10 pounds of hot dogs
He's going to buy sides that weigh half the amount of the hot dogs so that's 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 pounds of sides
He's buying 16 pounds of chicken, 8 pounds of hamburgers, 10 pounds of hot dogs and 5 pounds of sides for a total of 16+8+10+5 = <<16+8+10+5=39>>39 pounds of food

Last Saturday, the temperature was 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and he threw the ball twenty times. On Sunday, the temperature rose to 80 degrees Fahrenheit, and he threw the ball 30 times. Calculate the total number of yards he threw the ball in the two days.","On Saturday, he threw the ball 20 times, and since the temperature was 50 degrees, he could throw only 20 yards, totaling 20*20 = <<20*20=400>>400 yards.
On Sunday, the temperature favored him, and he threw the ball twice the distance he could throw on Saturday, which is 2*20 = <<2*20=40>>40 yards.
If he threw the ball 30 times, he threw for 30*40 = <<30*40=1200>>1200 yards.
In the two days, he threw 1200+400 = <<1200+400=1600>>1600 yards.

Each floor has 6 apartments, and each apartment needs 7 doors in total. How many doors does the company need to buy?","The number of floors is 12 floors/building x 2 buildings = 24 floors
The number of apartments is 6 apartments/floor x 24 floors = <<6*24=144>>144 apartments

Therefore, 40% * x = 0.4 * x = $60000
So x = $60000 / 0.4 = $150000.
If Company B gets 60 % of the profits, it gets 60% of $150000, which is 0.6 * $150000 = $<<0.6*150000=90000>>90000.

Rupert is 10 years older than Khloe but 2 years younger than Vincent who is 22 years old. How old, in years, is Tricia?","Rupert is younger than Vincent by 2 years, so he is 22 years old – 2 years = <<22-2=20>>20 years old.
Khloe is 10 years younger than Rupert so she is 20 years old – 10 years = 10 years old.
Eugene is 3 times older than Khloe so he is 10 years old * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 years old.
Yorick is twice Eugene’s age so he is 30 years old * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 years old.
Amilia is a quarter of Yorick’s age so she is 60 years old / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 years old.
