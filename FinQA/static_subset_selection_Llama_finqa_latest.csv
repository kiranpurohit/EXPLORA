223,what was the amount of the sum of the factors that contributed to the decrease in the gross operating revenues,31.6,"entergy new orleans , inc . management 2019s financial discussion and analysis the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase in electricity usage in the residential and commercial sectors due in part to a 4% ( 4 % ) increase in the average number of residential customers and a 3% ( 3 % ) increase in the average number of commercial customers , partially offset by the effect of less favorable weather on residential sales . gross operating revenues gross operating revenues decreased primarily due to : a decrease of $ 16.2 million in electric fuel cost recovery revenues due to lower fuel rates ; a decrease of $ 15.4 million in gross gas revenues primarily due to lower fuel cost recovery revenues as a result of lower fuel rates and the effect of milder weather ; and formula rate plan decreases effective october 2010 and october 2011 , as discussed above . the decrease was partially offset by an increase in gross wholesale revenue due to increased sales to affiliated customers and more favorable volume/weather , as discussed above . 2010 compared to 2009 net revenue consists of operating revenues net of : 1 ) fuel , fuel-related expenses , and gas purchased for resale , 2 ) purchased power expenses , and 3 ) other regulatory charges ( credits ) . following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2010 to 2009 . amount ( in millions ) . the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 348 gwh , or 7% ( 7 % ) , in billed retail electricity usage primarily due to more favorable weather compared to last year . the net gas revenue variance is primarily due to more favorable weather compared to last year , along with the recognition of a gas regulatory asset associated with the settlement of entergy new orleans 2019s electric and gas formula rate plans . see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the formula rate plan settlement . the effect of 2009 rate case settlement variance results from the april 2009 settlement of entergy new orleans 2019s rate case , and includes the effects of realigning non-fuel costs associated with the operation of grand gulf from the fuel adjustment clause to electric base rates effective june 2009 . see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case settlement . other income statement variances 2011 compared to 2010 other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to the deferral in 2011 of $ 13.4 million of 2010 michoud plant maintenance costs pursuant to the settlement of entergy new orleans 2019s 2010 test year formula rate plan filing approved by the city council in september 2011 and a decrease of $ 8.0 million in fossil- fueled generation expenses due to higher plant outage costs in 2010 due to a greater scope of work at the michoud plant . see note 2 to the financial statements for more discussion of the 2010 test year formula rate plan filing. ."," | amount ( in millions ) |

actions of various central banks ; changes in u.s . and non-u.s . interest rates ; changes in the various yield curves around the world ; revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards , or interpretations of those standards ; the amount of discount accretion generated by the former conduit securities that remain in our investment securities portfolio ; and the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the yields earned on securities sold or matured . based on market conditions and other factors , we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from pay-downs and maturities of investment securities in highly-rated securities , such as u.s . treasury and agency securities , municipal securities , federal agency mortgage-backed securities and u.s . and non-u.s . mortgage- and asset-backed securities . the pace at which we continue to reinvest and the types of investment securities purchased will depend on the impact of market conditions and other factors over time . we expect these factors and the levels of global interest rates to influence what effect our reinvestment program will have on future levels of our net interest revenue and net interest margin. .","( in millions ) | 2014 | 2013 | 2012 |

2372,"what was the percentage change in the cash and cash equivalents at june 30 , 2008 from 2007 .",-26%,"l iquidity and capital resources we have historically generated positive cash flow from operations and have generally used funds generated from operations and short-term borrowings on our revolving credit facility to meet capital requirements . we expect this trend to continue in the future . the company's cash and cash equivalents decreased to $ 65565 at june 30 , 2008 from $ 88617 at june 30 , 2007 . the following table summarizes net cash from operating activities in the statement of cash flows : year ended june 30 cash provided by operations increased $ 6754 to $ 181001 for the fiscal year ended june 30 , 2008 as compared to $ 174247 for the fiscal year ended june 30 , 2007 . this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in expenses that do not have a corresponding cash outflow , such as depreciation and amortization , as a percentage of total net income . cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 2008 was $ 102148 and includes payments for acquisitions of $ 48109 , plus $ 1215 in contingent consideration paid on prior years 2019 acquisitions . during fiscal 2007 , payments for acquisitions totaled $ 34006 , plus $ 5301 paid on earn-outs and other acquisition adjustments . capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 were $ 31105 compared to $ 34202 for fiscal 2007 . cash used for software development in fiscal 2008 was $ 23736 compared to $ 20743 during the prior year . net cash used in financing activities for the current fiscal year was $ 101905 and includes the repurchase of 4200 shares of our common stock for $ 100996 , the payment of dividends of $ 24683 and $ 429 net repayment on our revolving credit facilities . cash used in financing activities was partially offset by proceeds of $ 20394 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock and $ 3809 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises . during fiscal 2007 , net cash used in financing activities included the repurchase of our common stock for $ 98413 and the payment of dividends of $ 21685 . as in the current year , cash used in fiscal 2007 was partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock of $ 29212 , $ 4640 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises and $ 19388 net borrowings on revolving credit facilities . at june 30 , 2008 , the company had negative working capital of $ 11418 ; however , the largest component of current liabilities was deferred revenue of $ 212375 . the cash outlay necessary to provide the services related to these deferred revenues is significantly less than this recorded balance . therefore , we do not anticipate any liquidity problems to result from this condition . u.s . financial markets and many of the largest u.s . financial institutions have recently been shaken by negative developments in the home mortgage industry and the mortgage markets , and particularly the markets for subprime mortgage-backed securities . while we believe it is too early to predict what effect , if any , these developments may have , we have not experienced any significant issues with our current collec- tion efforts , and we believe that any future impact to our liquidity would be minimized by our access to available lines of credit . 2008 2007 2006 .","2007 | year ended june 30 2008 2007 | year ended june 30 2008 2007 | year ended june 30 2008 |

1104,"considering the contract terms of 10 years , what will be the total expense with the depreciation of the electronics and performance materials segment?\\n",110,"economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us , which may be less than its physical life . assumptions on the following factors , among others , affect the determination of estimated economic useful life : wear and tear , obsolescence , technical standards , contract life , market demand , competitive position , raw material availability , and geographic location . the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness , especially in light of changed business circumstances . for example , changes in technology , changes in the estimated future demand for products , or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated . in these cases , we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life , thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis . likewise , if the estimated useful life is increased , the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis . we have numerous long-term customer supply contracts , particularly in the gases on-site business within the tonnage gases segment . these contracts principally have initial contract terms of 15 to 20 years . there are also long-term customer supply contracts associated with the tonnage gases business within the electronics and performance materials segment . these contracts principally have initial terms of 10 to 15 years . additionally , we have several customer supply contracts within the equipment and energy segment with contract terms that are primarily five to 10 years . the depreciable lives of assets within this segment can be extended to 20 years for certain redeployable assets . depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term contracts are matched to the contract lives . extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term . as contract terms are extended , the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term , as long as it does not exceed the physical life of the asset . the depreciable lives of production facilities within the merchant gases segment are principally 15 years . customer contracts associated with products produced at these types of facilities typically have a much shorter term . the depreciable lives of production facilities within the electronics and performance materials segment , where there is not an associated long-term supply agreement , range from 10 to 15 years . these depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances , potential obsolescence , competitors 2019 actions , etc . management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change . a change in the depreciable life by one year for production facilities within the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments for which there is not an associated long-term customer supply agreement would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below : decrease life by 1 year increase life by 1 year . impairment of assets plant and equipment plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows . impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable . such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping , a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition , a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping , or changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets . if such circumstances are determined to exist , an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists . if an asset group is determined to be impaired , the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group 2019s fair value and its carrying value . an estimate of the asset group 2019s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows . assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell . the assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management 2019s best estimates at the time of the impairment review . factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions , sales volume and prices , costs to produce , inflation , etc . changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge . we use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing ."," | decrease lifeby 1 year | increase life by 1 year |

( a ) we utilize a non-gaap measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests . certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases , and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities , if the arrangement qualifies as a capital lease . additionally , the purchase of subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interests is accounted for as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows . the presentation of this non-gaap measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure that our management uses internally to evaluate and manage our expenditures . capital expenditures on a gaap basis in 2016 totaled $ 1055.8 , compared to $ 1265.6 in 2015 . the decrease of $ 209.8 was primarily due to the completion of major projects in 2016 and 2015 . additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine , ongoing nature , including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements . spending in 2016 and 2015 included plant and equipment constructed to provide oxygen for coal gasification in china , hydrogen to the global market , oxygen to the steel industry , nitrogen to the electronic semiconductor industry , and capacity expansion for the materials technologies segment . capital expenditures on a non-gaap basis in 2016 totaled $ 1083.0 compared to $ 1678.4 in 2015 . the decrease of $ 595.4 was primarily due to the prior year purchase of the 30.5% ( 30.5 % ) equity interest in our indura s.a . subsidiary from the largest minority shareholder for $ 277.9 . refer to note 21 , noncontrolling interests , to the consolidated financial statements for additional details . additionally , capital lease expenditures of $ 27.2 , decreased by $ 68.4 , reflecting lower project spending . on 19 april 2015 , a joint venture between air products and acwa holding entered into a 20-year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement to supply saudi aramco 2019s oil refinery and power plant being built in jazan , saudi arabia . air products owns 25% ( 25 % ) of the joint venture . during 2016 and 2015 , we recorded noncash transactions which resulted in an increase of $ 26.9 and $ 67.5 , respectively , to our investment in net assets of and advances to equity affiliates for our obligation to invest in the joint venture . these noncash transactions have been excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows . in total , we expect to invest approximately $ 100 in this joint venture . air products has also entered into a sale of equipment contract with the joint venture to engineer , procure , and construct the industrial gas facilities that will supply the gases to saudi aramco. ."," | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 |

3880,what was the operating margin for space systems in 2002?,6%,"lockheed martin corporation management 2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations december 31 , 2002 space systems space systems 2019 operating results included the following : ( in millions ) 2002 2001 2000 . net sales for space systems increased by 8% ( 8 % ) in 2002 compared to 2001 . the increase in sales for 2002 resulted from higher volume in government space of $ 370 million and commercial space of $ 180 million . in government space , increases of $ 470 million in government satellite programs and $ 130 million in ground systems activities more than offset volume declines of $ 175 million on government launch vehi- cles and $ 55 million on strategic missile programs . the increase in commercial space sales is primarily attributable to an increase in launch vehicle activities , with nine commercial launches during 2002 compared to six in 2001 . net sales for the segment decreased by 7% ( 7 % ) in 2001 com- pared to 2000 . the decrease in sales for 2001 resulted from volume declines in commercial space of $ 560 million , which more than offset increases in government space of $ 60 million . in commercial space , sales declined due to volume reductions of $ 480 million in commercial launch vehicle activities and $ 80 million in satellite programs . there were six launches in 2001 compared to 14 launches in 2000 . the increase in gov- ernment space resulted from a combined increase of $ 230 mil- lion related to higher volume on government satellite programs and ground systems activities . these increases were partially offset by a $ 110 million decrease related to volume declines in government launch vehicle activity , primarily due to program maturities , and by $ 50 million due to the absence in 2001 of favorable adjustments recorded on the titan iv pro- gram in 2000 . operating profit for the segment increased 23% ( 23 % ) in 2002 as compared to 2001 , mainly driven by the commercial space business . reduced losses in commercial space during 2002 resulted in increased operating profit of $ 90 million when compared to 2001 . commercial satellite manufacturing losses declined $ 100 million in 2002 as operating performance improved and satellite deliveries increased . in the first quarter of 2001 , a $ 40 million loss provision was recorded on certain commercial satellite manufacturing contracts . due to the industry-wide oversupply and deterioration of pricing in the commercial launch market , financial results on commercial launch vehicles continue to be challenging . during 2002 , this trend led to a decline in operating profit of $ 10 million on commercial launch vehicles when compared to 2001 . this decrease was primarily due to lower profitability of $ 55 mil- lion on the three additional launches in the current year , addi- tional charges of $ 60 million ( net of a favorable contract adjustment of $ 20 million ) for market and pricing pressures and included the adverse effect of a $ 35 million adjustment for commercial launch vehicle contract settlement costs . the 2001 results also included charges for market and pricing pressures , which reduced that year 2019s operating profit by $ 145 million . the $ 10 million decrease in government space 2019s operating profit for the year is primarily due to the reduced volume on government launch vehicles and strategic missile programs , which combined to decrease operating profit by $ 80 million , partially offset by increases of $ 40 million in government satellite programs and $ 30 million in ground systems activities . operating profit for the segment increased by 4% ( 4 % ) in 2001 compared to 2000 . operating profit increased in 2001 due to a $ 35 million increase in government space partially offset by higher year-over-year losses of $ 20 million in commercial space . in government space , operating profit increased due to the impact of higher volume and improved performance in ground systems and government satellite programs . the year- to-year comparison of operating profit was not affected by the $ 50 million favorable titan iv adjustment recorded in 2000 discussed above , due to a $ 55 million charge related to a more conservative assessment of government launch vehi- cle programs that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000 . in commercial space , decreased operating profit of $ 15 mil- lion on launch vehicles more than offset lower losses on satel- lite manufacturing activities . the commercial launch vehicle operating results included $ 60 million in higher charges for market and pricing pressures when compared to 2000 . these negative adjustments were partially offset by $ 50 million of favorable contract adjustments on certain launch vehicle con- tracts . commercial satellite manufacturing losses decreased slightly from 2000 and included the adverse impact of a $ 40 million loss provision recorded in the first quarter of 2001 for certain commercial satellite contracts related to schedule and technical issues. .","( in millions ) | 2002 | 2001 | 2000 |

( a ) includes $ 3.3 billion relating to fiber supply agreements entered into at the time of the company 2019s 2006 transformation plan forestland sales and in conjunction with the 2008 acquisition of weyerhaeuser company 2019s containerboard , packaging and recycling business . rent expense was $ 215 million , $ 231 million and $ 205 million for 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively . guarantees in connection with sales of businesses , property , equipment , forestlands and other assets , international paper commonly makes representations and warranties relating to such businesses or assets , and may agree to indemnify buyers with respect to tax and environmental liabilities , breaches of representations and warranties , and other matters . where liabilities for such matters are determined to be probable and subject to reasonable estimation , accrued liabilities are recorded at the time of sale as a cost of the transaction . environmental proceedings international paper has been named as a potentially responsible party in environmental remediation actions under various federal and state laws , including the comprehensive environmental response , compensation and liability act ( cercla ) . many of these proceedings involve the cleanup of hazardous substances at large commercial landfills that received waste from many different sources . while joint and several liability is authorized under cercla and equivalent state laws , as a practical matter , liability for cercla cleanups is typically allocated among the many potential responsible parties . remedial costs are recorded in the consolidated financial statements when they become probable and reasonably estimable . international paper has estimated the probable liability associated with these matters to be approximately $ 94 million in the aggregate at december 31 , 2013 . cass lake : one of the matters referenced above is a closed wood treating facility located in cass lake , minnesota . during 2009 , in connection with an environmental site remediation action under cercla , international paper submitted to the epa a site remediation feasibility study . in june 2011 , the epa selected and published a proposed soil remedy at the site with an estimated cost of $ 46 million . the overall remediation reserve for the site is currently $ 51 million to address this selection of an alternative for the soil remediation component of the overall site remedy . in october 2011 , the epa released a public statement indicating that the final soil remedy decision would be delayed . in the unlikely event that the epa changes its proposed soil remedy and approves instead a more expensive clean-up alternative , the remediation costs could be material , and significantly higher than amounts currently recorded . in october 2012 , the natural resource trustees for this site provided notice to international paper and other potentially responsible parties of their intent to perform a natural resource damage assessment . it is premature to predict the outcome of the assessment or to estimate a loss or range of loss , if any , which may be incurred . other : in addition to the above matters , other remediation costs typically associated with the cleanup of hazardous substances at the company 2019s current , closed or formerly-owned facilities , and recorded as liabilities in the balance sheet , totaled approximately $ 42 million at december 31 , 2013 . other than as described above , completion of required remedial actions is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements . kalamazoo river : the company is a potentially responsible party with respect to the allied paper , inc./ portage creek/kalamazoo river superfund site ( kalamazoo river superfund site ) in michigan . the epa asserts that the site is contaminated primarily by pcbs as a result of discharges from various paper mills located along the kalamazoo river , including a paper mill formerly owned by st . regis paper company ( st . regis ) . the company is a successor in interest to st . regis . the company has not received any orders from the epa with respect to the site and continues to collect information from the epa and other parties relative to the site to evaluate the extent of its liability , if any , with respect to the site . accordingly , it is premature to estimate a loss or range of loss with respect to this site . also in connection with the kalamazoo river superfund site , the company was named as a defendant by georgia-pacific consumer products lp , fort james corporation and georgia pacific llc in a contribution and cost recovery action for alleged pollution at the site . the suit seeks contribution under cercla for $ 79 million in costs purportedly expended by plaintiffs as of the filing of the complaint and for future remediation costs . the suit alleges that a mill , during the time it was allegedly owned and operated by st . regis , discharged pcb contaminated solids and paper residuals resulting from paper de-inking and recycling . also named as defendants in the suit are ncr corporation and weyerhaeuser company . in mid-2011

4431,"at december 31 , 2008 what was the percent of the gross interest associated to the gross uncertain tax position expected to be resolved to",20%,"the company is currently under audit by the internal revenue service and other major taxing jurisdictions around the world . it is thus reasonably possible that significant changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next 12 months , but the company does not expect such audits to result in amounts that would cause a significant change to its effective tax rate , other than the following items . the company is currently at irs appeals for the years 1999 20132002 . one of the issues relates to the timing of the inclusion of interchange fees received by the company relating to credit card purchases by its cardholders . it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months the company can either reach agreement on this issue at appeals or decide to litigate the issue . this issue is presently being litigated by another company in a united states tax court case . the gross uncertain tax position for this item at december 31 , 2008 is $ 542 million . since this is a temporary difference , the only effect to the company 2019s effective tax rate would be due to net interest and state tax rate differentials . if the reserve were to be released , the tax benefit could be as much as $ 168 million . in addition , the company expects to conclude the irs audit of its u.s . federal consolidated income tax returns for the years 2003 20132005 within the next 12 months . the gross uncertain tax position at december 31 , 2008 for the items expected to be resolved is approximately $ 350 million plus gross interest of $ 70 million . the potential net tax benefit to continuing operations could be approximately $ 325 million . the following are the major tax jurisdictions in which the company and its affiliates operate and the earliest tax year subject to examination: . foreign pretax earnings approximated $ 10.3 billion in 2008 , $ 9.1 billion in 2007 , and $ 13.6 billion in 2006 ( $ 5.1 billion , $ 0.7 billion and $ 0.9 billion of which , respectively , are in discontinued operations ) . as a u.s . corporation , citigroup and its u.s . subsidiaries are subject to u.s . taxation currently on all foreign pretax earnings earned by a foreign branch . pretax earnings of a foreign subsidiary or affiliate are subject to u.s . taxation when effectively repatriated . the company provides income taxes on the undistributed earnings of non-u.s . subsidiaries except to the extent that such earnings are indefinitely invested outside the united states . at december 31 , 2008 , $ 22.8 billion of accumulated undistributed earnings of non-u.s . subsidiaries were indefinitely invested . at the existing u.s . federal income tax rate , additional taxes ( net of u.s . foreign tax credits ) of $ 6.1 billion would have to be provided if such earnings were remitted currently . the current year 2019s effect on the income tax expense from continuing operations is included in the foreign income tax rate differential line in the reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the company 2019s effective income tax rate on the previous page . income taxes are not provided for on the company 2019s savings bank base year bad debt reserves that arose before 1988 because under current u.s . tax rules such taxes will become payable only to the extent such amounts are distributed in excess of limits prescribed by federal law . at december 31 , 2008 , the amount of the base year reserves totaled approximately $ 358 million ( subject to a tax of $ 125 million ) . the company has no valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at december 31 , 2008 and december 31 , 2007 . at december 31 , 2008 , the company had a u.s . foreign tax-credit carryforward of $ 10.5 billion , $ 0.4 billion whose expiry date is 2016 , $ 5.3 billion whose expiry date is 2017 and $ 4.8 billion whose expiry date is 2018 . the company has a u.s federal consolidated net operating loss ( nol ) carryforward of approximately $ 13 billion whose expiration date is 2028 . the company also has a general business credit carryforward of $ 0.6 billion whose expiration dates are 2027-2028 . the company has state and local net operating loss carryforwards of $ 16.2 billion and $ 4.9 billion in new york state and new york city , respectively . this consists of $ 2.4 billion and $ 1.2 billion , whose expiration date is 2027 and $ 13.8 billion and $ 3.7 billion whose expiration date is 2028 and for which the company has recorded a deferred-tax asset of $ 1.2 billion , along with less significant net operating losses in various other states for which the company has recorded a deferred-tax asset of $ 399 million and which expire between 2012 and 2028 . in addition , the company has recorded deferred-tax assets in apb 23 subsidiaries for foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 130 million ( which expires in 2018 ) and $ 101 million ( with no expiration ) . although realization is not assured , the company believes that the realization of the recognized net deferred tax asset of $ 44.5 billion is more likely than not based on expectations as to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which it operates and available tax planning strategies , as defined in sfas 109 , that could be implemented if necessary to prevent a carryforward from expiring . the company 2019s net deferred tax asset ( dta ) of $ 44.5 billion consists of approximately $ 36.5 billion of net u.s . federal dtas , $ 4 billion of net state dtas and $ 4 billion of net foreign dtas . included in the net federal dta of $ 36.5 billion are deferred tax liabilities of $ 4 billion that will reverse in the relevant carryforward period and may be used to support the dta . the major components of the u.s . federal dta are $ 10.5 billion in foreign tax-credit carryforwards , $ 4.6 billion in a net-operating-loss carryforward , $ 0.6 billion in a general-business-credit carryforward , $ 19.9 billion in net deductions that have not yet been taken on a tax return , and $ 0.9 billion in compensation deductions , which reduced additional paid-in capital in january 2009 and for which sfas 123 ( r ) did not permit any adjustment to such dta at december 31 , 2008 because the related stock compensation was not yet deductible to the company . in general , citigroup would need to generate approximately $ 85 billion of taxable income during the respective carryforward periods to fully realize its federal , state and local dtas. .","jurisdiction | tax year |

value . level 1 inputs are quoted prices ( unadjusted ) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities , are considered to be the most reliable evidence of fair value , and should be used whenever available . level 2 inputs are observable prices that are not quoted on active exchanges . level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs employed for measuring the fair value of assets or
