2372,"what was the percentage change in the cash and cash equivalents at june 30 , 2008 from 2007 .",-26%,"l iquidity and capital resources we have historically generated positive cash flow from operations and have generally used funds generated from operations and short-term borrowings on our revolving credit facility to meet capital requirements . we expect this trend to continue in the future . the company's cash and cash equivalents decreased to $ 65565 at june 30 , 2008 from $ 88617 at june 30 , 2007 . the following table summarizes net cash from operating activities in the statement of cash flows : year ended june 30 cash provided by operations increased $ 6754 to $ 181001 for the fiscal year ended june 30 , 2008 as compared to $ 174247 for the fiscal year ended june 30 , 2007 . this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in expenses that do not have a corresponding cash outflow , such as depreciation and amortization , as a percentage of total net income . cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 2008 was $ 102148 and includes payments for acquisitions of $ 48109 , plus $ 1215 in contingent consideration paid on prior years 2019 acquisitions . during fiscal 2007 , payments for acquisitions totaled $ 34006 , plus $ 5301 paid on earn-outs and other acquisition adjustments . capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 were $ 31105 compared to $ 34202 for fiscal 2007 . cash used for software development in fiscal 2008 was $ 23736 compared to $ 20743 during the prior year . net cash used in financing activities for the current fiscal year was $ 101905 and includes the repurchase of 4200 shares of our common stock for $ 100996 , the payment of dividends of $ 24683 and $ 429 net repayment on our revolving credit facilities . cash used in financing activities was partially offset by proceeds of $ 20394 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock and $ 3809 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises . during fiscal 2007 , net cash used in financing activities included the repurchase of our common stock for $ 98413 and the payment of dividends of $ 21685 . as in the current year , cash used in fiscal 2007 was partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock of $ 29212 , $ 4640 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises and $ 19388 net borrowings on revolving credit facilities . at june 30 , 2008 , the company had negative working capital of $ 11418 ; however , the largest component of current liabilities was deferred revenue of $ 212375 . the cash outlay necessary to provide the services related to these deferred revenues is significantly less than this recorded balance . therefore , we do not anticipate any liquidity problems to result from this condition . u.s . financial markets and many of the largest u.s . financial institutions have recently been shaken by negative developments in the home mortgage industry and the mortgage markets , and particularly the markets for subprime mortgage-backed securities . while we believe it is too early to predict what effect , if any , these developments may have , we have not experienced any significant issues with our current collec- tion efforts , and we believe that any future impact to our liquidity would be minimized by our access to available lines of credit . 2008 2007 2006 .","2007 | year ended june 30 2008 2007 | year ended june 30 2008 2007 | year ended june 30 2008 |

1104,"considering the contract terms of 10 years , what will be the total expense with the depreciation of the electronics and performance materials segment?\\n",110,"economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us , which may be less than its physical life . assumptions on the following factors , among others , affect the determination of estimated economic useful life : wear and tear , obsolescence , technical standards , contract life , market demand , competitive position , raw material availability , and geographic location . the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness , especially in light of changed business circumstances . for example , changes in technology , changes in the estimated future demand for products , or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated . in these cases , we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life , thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis . likewise , if the estimated useful life is increased , the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis . we have numerous long-term customer supply contracts , particularly in the gases on-site business within the tonnage gases segment . these contracts principally have initial contract terms of 15 to 20 years . there are also long-term customer supply contracts associated with the tonnage gases business within the electronics and performance materials segment . these contracts principally have initial terms of 10 to 15 years . additionally , we have several customer supply contracts within the equipment and energy segment with contract terms that are primarily five to 10 years . the depreciable lives of assets within this segment can be extended to 20 years for certain redeployable assets . depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term contracts are matched to the contract lives . extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term . as contract terms are extended , the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term , as long as it does not exceed the physical life of the asset . the depreciable lives of production facilities within the merchant gases segment are principally 15 years . customer contracts associated with products produced at these types of facilities typically have a much shorter term . the depreciable lives of production facilities within the electronics and performance materials segment , where there is not an associated long-term supply agreement , range from 10 to 15 years . these depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances , potential obsolescence , competitors 2019 actions , etc . management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change . a change in the depreciable life by one year for production facilities within the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments for which there is not an associated long-term customer supply agreement would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below : decrease life by 1 year increase life by 1 year . impairment of assets plant and equipment plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows . impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable . such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping , a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition , a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping , or changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets . if such circumstances are determined to exist , an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists . if an asset group is determined to be impaired , the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group 2019s fair value and its carrying value . an estimate of the asset group 2019s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows . assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell . the assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management 2019s best estimates at the time of the impairment review . factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions , sales volume and prices , costs to produce , inflation , etc . changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge . we use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing ."," | decrease lifeby 1 year | increase life by 1 year |

3982,"in 2017 what percentage of contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at december 31 , 2016 is due to maturities of long-term debt?",7%,"ilim holding s.a . shareholder 2019s agreement in october 2007 , in connection with the formation of the ilim holding s.a . joint venture , international paper entered into a shareholder 2019s agreement that includes provisions relating to the reconciliation of disputes among the partners . this agreement provides that at any time , either the company or its partners may commence procedures specified under the deadlock agreement . if these or any other deadlock procedures under the shareholder's agreement are commenced , although it is not obligated to do so , the company may in certain situations choose to purchase its partners' 50% ( 50 % ) interest in ilim . any such transaction would be subject to review and approval by russian and other relevant anti-trust authorities . based on the provisions of the agreement , the company estimates that the current purchase price for its partners' 50% ( 50 % ) interests would be approximately $ 1.5 billion , which could be satisfied by payment of cash or international paper common stock , or some combination of the two , at the company's option . the purchase by the company of its partners 2019 50% ( 50 % ) interest in ilim would result in the consolidation of ilim's financial position and results of operations in all subsequent periods . the parties have informed each other that they have no current intention to commence procedures specified under the deadlock provisions of the shareholder 2019s agreement . critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets , liabilities , revenues and expenses . some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain . accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper , and that can require judgments by management that affect their application , include the accounting for contingencies , impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and goodwill , pensions and postretirement benefit obligations , stock options and income taxes . the company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of significant estimates with the audit and finance committee of the company 2019s board of directors . contingent liabilities accruals for contingent liabilities , including legal and environmental matters , are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated . liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel . liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs . impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill an impairment of a long-lived asset exists when the asset 2019s carrying amount exceeds its fair value , and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through cash flows from future operations . a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value . assessments of possible impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations . additionally , testing for possible impairment of goodwill and intangible asset balances is required annually . the amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair market value of the related assets based on management 2019s best estimates of certain key factors , including future selling prices and volumes , operating , raw material , energy and freight costs , and various other projected operating economic factors . as these key factors change in future periods , the company will update its impairment analyses to reflect its latest estimates and projections . under the provisions of accounting standards codification ( asc ) 350 , 201cintangibles 2013 goodwill and other , 201d the testing of goodwill for possible impairment is a two-step process . in the first step , the fair value of the company 2019s reporting units is compared with their carrying value , including goodwill . if fair value exceeds the carrying value , goodwill is not considered to be impaired . if the fair value of a reporting unit is below the carrying value , then step two is performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss for the reporting unit . this analysis requires the determination of the fair value of all of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit , including any currently unrecognized intangible assets , as if the reporting unit had been purchased on the analysis date . once these fair values have been determined , the implied fair value of the unit 2019s goodwill is calculated as the excess , if any , of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets determined in step two . the carrying value of goodwill is then reduced to this implied value , or to zero if the fair value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit , through a goodwill impairment charge . the impairment analysis requires a number of judgments by management . in calculating the estimated fair value of its reporting units in step one , a total debt-to-capital ratio of less than 60% ( 60 % ) . net worth is defined as the sum of common stock , paid-in capital and retained earnings , less treasury stock plus any cumulative goodwill impairment charges . the calculation also excludes accumulated other comprehensive income/loss and nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities . the total debt-to-capital ratio is defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus net worth . the company was in compliance with all its debt covenants at december 31 , 2016 and was well below the thresholds stipulated under the covenants as defined in the credit agreements . the company will continue to rely upon debt and capital markets for the majority of any necessary long-term funding not provided by operating cash flows . funding decisions will be guided by our capital structure planning objectives . the primary goals of the company 2019s capital structure planning are to maximize financial flexibility and preserve liquidity while reducing interest expense . the majority of international paper 2019s debt is accessed through global public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors . maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of international paper 2019s financing strategy . at december 31 , 2016 , the company held long-term credit ratings of bbb ( stable outlook ) and baa2 ( stable outlook ) by s&p and moody 2019s , respectively . contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at december 31 , 2016 , were as follows: .

( b ) includes $ 2 billion relating to fiber supply agreements entered into at the time of the 2006 transformation plan forestland sales and in conjunction with the 2008 acquisition of weyerhaeuser company 2019s containerboard , packaging and recycling business . also includes $ 1.1 billion relating to fiber supply agreements assumed in conjunction with the 2016 acquisition of weyerhaeuser's pulp business . ( c ) not included in the above table due to the uncertainty as to the amount and timing of the payment are unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $ 77 million . we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 , 2016 , to be indefinitely reinvested and , accordingly , no u.s . income taxes have been provided thereon . as of december 31 , 2016 , the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $ 620 million . we do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the united states to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business , including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements . pension obligations and funding at december 31 , 2016 , the projected benefit obligation for the company 2019s u.s . defined benefit plans determined under u.s . gaap was approximately $ 3.4 billion higher than the fair value of plan assets . approximately $ 3.0 billion of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements . under current irs funding rules , the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefits ( the projected benefit obligation ) for accounting purposes . in december 2008 , the worker , retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 ( wera ) was passed by the u.s . congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections . funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the company , and the timing of its implementation , as well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding level . the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and elected to make contributions totaling $ 750 million for both years ended december 31 , 2016 and 2015 . at this time , we do not expect to have any required contributions to our plans in 2017 , although the company may elect to make future voluntary contributions . the timing and amount of future contributions , which could be material , will depend on a number of factors , including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates . international paper announced a voluntary , limited-time opportunity for former employees who are participants in the retirement plan of international paper company ( the pension plan ) to request early payment of their entire pension plan benefit in the form of a single lump sum payment . the amount of total payments under this program was approximately $ 1.2 billion , and were made from plan trust assets on june 30 , 2016 . based on the level of payments made , settlement accounting rules applied and resulted in a plan remeasurement as of the june 30 , 2016 payment date . as a result of settlement accounting , the company recognized a pro-rata portion of the unamortized net actuarial loss , after remeasurement , resulting in a $ 439 million non-cash charge to the company's earnings in the second quarter of 2016 . additional payments of $ 8 million and $ 9 million were made during the third and fourth quarters , respectively , due to mandatory cash payouts and a small lump sum payout , and the pension plan was subsequently remeasured at september 30 , 2016 and december 31 , 2016 . as a result of settlement accounting , the company recognized non-cash settlement charges of $ 3 million in both the third and fourth quarters of 2016. .","in millions | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | thereafter |
