## EXPLORA: Efficient Exemplar Subset Selection for Complex In-context Numerical Reasoning

This repository contains the implementation details of our Exemplar Selection Algorithm for In-context Learning.



## Requirements
The code is written for python `3.9`, but should work for other version with some modifications.
Create a conda environment with python version `3.9`.  Install cudatoolkit according to gpu compatibility.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
