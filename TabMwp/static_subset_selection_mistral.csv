To find the probability that a key is labeled with a blue sticker and opens the back door of the house, first identify the sample space and the event.
The outcomes in the sample space are the different keys. Each key is equally likely to be selected, so this is a uniform probability model.
The event is A and B, ""the key is labeled with a blue sticker and opens the back door of the house"".
Since this is a uniform probability model, count the number of outcomes in the event A and B and count the total number of outcomes. Then, divide them to compute the probability.

Find the number of outcomes in the event A and B.
A and B is the event ""the key is labeled with a blue sticker and opens the back door of the house"", so look at the table to see how many keys are labeled with a blue sticker and open the back door of the house.
The number of keys that are labeled with a blue sticker and open the back door of the house is 3.

Find the total number of outcomes.
Add all the numbers in the table to find the total number of keys.
5 + 7 + 3 + 5 = 20

Find P(A and B).
Since all outcomes are equally likely, the probability of event A and B is the number of outcomes in event A and B divided by the total number of outcomes.
P(A and B) = \frac{# of outcomes in A and B}{total # of outcomes}
 = \frac{3}{20}
The probability that a key is labeled with a blue sticker and opens the back door of the house is \frac{3}{20}.",free_text,decimal_number,8,train,1,6836

To find the probability that a bow tie is designed with swirls and is made of cotton, first identify the sample space and the event.
The outcomes in the sample space are the different bow ties. Each bow tie is equally likely to be selected, so this is a uniform probability model.
The event is A and B, ""the bow tie is designed with swirls and is made of cotton"".
Since this is a uniform probability model, count the number of outcomes in the event A and B and count the total number of outcomes. Then, divide them to compute the probability.

Find the number of outcomes in the event A and B.
A and B is the event ""the bow tie is designed with swirls and is made of cotton"", so look at the table to see how many bow ties are designed with swirls and are made of cotton.
The number of bow ties that are designed with swirls and are made of cotton is 3.

Find the total number of outcomes.
Add all the numbers in the table to find the total number of bow ties.
7 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 20

Find P(A and B).
Since all outcomes are equally likely, the probability of event A and B is the number of outcomes in event A and B divided by the total number of outcomes.

Pick the points in any two rows of the table and calculate the rate of change between them. The first two rows are a good place to start.
Call the values in the first row x1 and y1. Call the values in the second row x2 and y2.
Rate of change = \frac{y2 - y1}{x2 - x1}
 = \frac{18 - 14}{17 - 16}
 = \frac{4}{1}

Now pick any other two rows and calculate the rate of change between them.
Call the values in the second row x1 and y1. Call the values in the third row x2 and y2.
Rate of change = \frac{y2 - y1}{x2 - x1}
 = \frac{19 - 18}{18 - 17}

The rate of change is not the same for each pair of points. So, the function does not have a constant rate of change.
The function is nonlinear.",multi_choice,boolean_text,8,train,3,156
