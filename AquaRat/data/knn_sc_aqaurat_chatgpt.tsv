John invested $100 in each of the funds A and B. After one year, the value of the money in fund A was $10 higher than the value of the money in fund B. After another year, the value of the money in fund A was $25 higher than the value of the money in fund B. If the value of the money in each fund increased by a fixed interest compounded annually, what was the annual interest of fund A?	"Rationale: Let the annual interest rate for fund A be \(x\%\) and for fund B be \(y\%\).

After one year:
For Fund A: \(100 + 100 \times \frac{x}{100} = 100(1 + \frac{x}{100})\)
For Fund B: \(100 + 100 \times \frac{y}{100} = 100(1 + \frac{y}{100})\)

Given that after one year, the value of money in Fund A was $10 higher than in Fund B:
\(100(1 + \frac{x}{100}) = 10 + 100(1 + \frac{y}{100})\)
\(1 + \frac{x}{100} = 1 + \frac{y}{10}\)
This implies that \(x = y+10\) -----(Equation 1)

After another year (two years total):
For Fund A: \(110(1+\frac{x}{200}) = 110(1+\frac{(y+10)}{200})\)
For Fund B: \(110(1+\frac{y}{200})\)

Given that after two years, the value of money in Fund A was $25"

M is a set of even numbers from 1 to 23 and odd numbers from 24 to 100. Find no. of zeroes in the sum of all values in the set.	"Rationale: 
Let's first find the sum of even numbers from 1 to 23:
Sum of an arithmetic series = (number of terms / 2) * (first term + last term)
Number of even numbers from 1 to 23 = 23/2 = 11.5 (as there are half as many even numbers in this range)
First even number = 2, Last even number = 22
Sum of even numbers from 1 to 23 = (11.5 / 2) * (2 + 22) = 5.75 *24 =138

Now, let's find the sum of odd numbers from 24 to100:
Number of odd numbers from 24 to100= ((100-24)/2)+1=39
First odd number=25, Last odd number=99
Sum of odd numbers from24to100=((39/2)*(25+99))=(19.5*124)=2418

Total sum=sumofevennumbers+sumofoddnumbers=138+2418=2556

Now, we need to find the number of zeroes in this total sum.
The only way a zero can be obtained is by multiplying by multiples of powers of ten.

"A salesman enters the quantity sold and the price into the computer. Both the numbers are two-digit numbers. But, by mistake, both the numbers were entered with their digits interchanged. The total sales value remained the same, i.e. Rs. 1,148, but the inventory reduced by 54.
What is the actual price per piece?"	"Rationale: Let the original quantity sold be 10a + b and the original price be 10c + d.

The total sales value is given by (10a + b)(10c + d) = 1148.

When the digits are interchanged, the new quantity sold becomes 10b + a and the new price becomes 10d + c.

The new total sales value is then (10b + a)(10d + c).

Given that both total sales values are equal, we have:
(10a + b)(10c + d) = (10b + a)(10d + c)
Expanding both sides gives:
100ac+ 10(ad+bc)+bd=100bd+ 10(ad+bc)+ac
Simplifying further gives:
100(ac - bd) = ac - bd
99(ac - bd) = 0
Since ac and bd are two-digit numbers, ac - bd cannot be zero.
Therefore, there seems to be an error in this question as it leads to an inconsistent equation."

The spherical ball of lead 3 cm in diameter is melted and recast into 3 spherical balls. The diameters of two of these are 1 1/2 cm and 2 cm respectively. The diameter of third ball is?	"Rationale: When a spherical ball is melted and recast into smaller spherical balls, the volume remains the same. The volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = (4/3)πr³, where r is the radius of the sphere.

Given that the original lead ball has a diameter of 3 cm, its radius (r) would be half of that, which is 1.5 cm.

The total volume of the smaller spherical balls formed after melting can be expressed as:
V_total = V₁ + V₂ + V₃

Since we know that V = (4/3)πr³, we can calculate the volumes for each new sphere using their respective radii:
V₁ = (4/3)π(1.5)³
V₂ = (4/3)π(1)
V₃ = (4/3)π(r₃)³

Given that two of these spheres have diameters 1 1/2 cm and 2 cm respectively, their radii are 0.75 cm and 1 cm.

Substitute these values into our equation:
(4/3)π(1.5)^3 + (4/3)π(0.75"

At an amusement park, tom bought a number of red tokens and green tokens. Each red token costs $0.05, and each green token costs $0.14. If Tom spent a total of exactly $2.06, how many token in total did Tom buy?	"Rationale: Let the number of red tokens Tom bought be x and the number of green tokens be y. 

The total cost equation can be written as:
0.05x + 0.14y = 2.06

We also know that the total number of tokens bought is x + y.

To solve this system of equations, we need to find integer solutions for x and y that satisfy both equations.

Let's multiply the first equation by 100 to clear decimals:
5x + 14y = 206

Now we have a system of two linear equations:
1) 5x + 14y = 206
2) x + y = Total number of tokens

From equation (2), we can write:
x = Total number of tokens - y

Substitute this into equation (1):
5(Total number of tokens - y) + 14y = 206
5Total number of tokens - 5y + 14y = 206
5Total number of tokens +9y=206
9y=206-5Total no.of token
9*y=6+11*18-10*20+7*27-8*28

A fisherman's day is rated as good if he catches 9 fishes, fair if he catches 7 fishes and poor if he catches 5 fishes. The fisherman catches 53 fishes in a week that includes good, fair and poor days. How many good days the fisherman had during the week?	"Rationale: Let's denote the number of good days as \(x\), fair days as \(y\), and poor days as \(z\). We are given that:
1. A good day yields 9 fishes, so the total number of fishes from good days = \(9x\).
2. A fair day yields 7 fishes, so the total number of fishes from fair days = \(7y\).
3. A poor day yields 5 fishes, so the total number of fishes from poor days = \(5z\).

Given that the fisherman catches a total of 53 fishes in a week:
\[9x + 7y + 5z = 53 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}\]

We also know that there are a total of seven days in a week, so:
\[x + y + z = 7 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}\]

To solve for the number of good days (\(x\)), we need to find values for \(y\) and \(z\) first.

Let's try different combinations to satisfy Equation (1) and Equation (2):
- If we take one good day (\(x=1\)), then two fair days and four poor"

At a delivery store, seven packages have an average (arithmetic mean) weight of 222 kg and a median weight of 270 kg. What is the maximum possible weight, in kilograms, of the lightest package?	"Rationale: Let's denote the weights of the seven packages as \( a, b, c, d, e, f, g \) in ascending order. Since the median weight is 270 kg and there are 7 packages arranged in ascending order, the fourth package's weight must be 270 kg.

Therefore, \( d = 270 \).

The average weight of all seven packages is given as 222 kg. So we have:

\( (a + b + c + d + e + f + g) / 7 = 222 \)

Substitute \( d = 270 \) into the equation above:

\( (a + b + c + 270 + e + f+ g) /7 = 222 \)

Simplify to get:

\( a+b+c+e+f+g=1554 \)

Since we want to find the maximum possible weight of the lightest package which corresponds to 'a', we need to minimize \( b+c+e+f+g \). To do this while keeping their sum constant at \(1554\), let's make them equal. This way each will be equal to \(1554/5=310\) for minimum value.

Thus,

\( a =310 -b-c-d-e-f"

Davji Shop sells samosas in boxes of different sizes. The samosas are priced at Rs. 2 per samosa up to 200 samosas. For every additional 20 samosas, the price of the whole lot goes down by 10 paise per samosa. What should be the maximum size of the box that would maximise the revenue?	"Rationale: Let's assume the maximum size of the box to be x, and let's calculate the revenue for different sizes of boxes.

For the first 200 samosas, each samosa costs Rs. 2.
So, revenue for the first 200 samosas = 200 * 2 = Rs. 400.

For additional samosas beyond 200:
- For every additional 20 samosas, the price decreases by 10 paise per samosa.
- This means for every additional set of 20 samosas, there is a decrease in total cost by (20 * 0.10) = Rs.2.

Let's calculate how many sets of extra 20s can be accommodated in a box size x:
Number of extra sets of 20s = (x - 200) / 20

Total revenue from these extra sets would be:
= Total number of extra samosas * Reduced price per set
= Number of extra sets * (Rs.2 - Rs.(0.10*20))
= Number of extra sets * (Rs.2 - Rs.2)
= Number of extra sets * Rs.0

This implies that there will be no change in revenue beyond the initial sale as any reduction in price is"

Consider a school which consists of boys, girls and one teacher. There twice as many girls as boys. During prayer, this school follows a procedure where people bows to each other. Each girl and boy is required to bow to other girls, boys and their teacher. Each day 900 bows are completed. Find how many boys there are in the school ?	"Rationale: Let's denote the number of boys as B, the number of girls as G, and there is 1 teacher. Given that there are twice as many girls as boys, we can write this as G = 2B.

During prayer, each girl bows to other girls, boys, and the teacher. So each girl makes (G + B + 1) bows in total. Similarly, each boy also bows to other girls, boys, and the teacher making (G + B + 1) bows in total.

Given that each day 900 bows are completed in total:
Total number of bows made by all girls = G * (G + B + 1)
Total number of bows made by all boys = B * (G + B + 1)

Since there are no self-bows or repetitions,
Total number of bows = Total number of bows made by all girls + Total number of bows made by all boys
Therefore,
900 = G * (G + B + 1) + B * (G+ B+ 1)
Substitute G = 2B into the equation above:
900 = 2B(3B+1) + B(3B+1)
900 = 6B^2+"
"I have an amazing bath tub having both hot and cold water taps.
The cold water tap can fill my tub in 6 hours while cold water tap can fill the tub in approximately 4 hours.
I turned them on simultaneously but forgot to close the lid which removes the water out of tub.
The lid can empty the tub in exact 13 hours.
Since both taps are open along with the lib, can you estimate the time needed to fill the bath tub?"	"Rationale: Let's denote the rate at which the hot water tap fills the tub as H, and the rate at which the cold water tap fills the tub as C. We can calculate their rates using the formula: Rate = Work / Time.

From the given information:
- The hot water tap fills the tub in 6 hours, so its rate is H = 1/6.
- The cold water tap fills the tub in 4 hours, so its rate is C = 1/4.
- The lid empties the tub in 13 hours, so its rate is -1/13 (negative because it removes water).

When both taps are open along with the lid, their combined rate of filling will be (H + C - L), where L represents the rate of emptying by closing lid.

Therefore, (H + C - L) = (1/6 + 1/4 - 1/13) = (13 + 19 - 24) /78 = 8 /78

Now we need to find out how long it takes for both taps along with lid to fill up a whole bathtub. This can be calculated using Time = Work / Rate.

Time taken to fill up a whole bathtub with all three working together"
