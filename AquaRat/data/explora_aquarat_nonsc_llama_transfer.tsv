In the xy-coordinate plane, which of the following points must lie on the line kx + 2y = 6 for every possible value of k?	"Rationale: To find the point that must lie on the line for every possible value of k, we can substitute different points into the equation and check which one satisfies it for all values of k.

Let's substitute each given point into the equation kx + 2y = 6:

For point (1,1):
k(1) + 2(1) = 6
k + 2 = 6
k = 4

For point (0,3):
k(0) + 2(3) = 6
0 + 6 = 6

For point (2,0):
k(2) + 2(0) = 6
2k = 6
k = 3

For point (3,6):
k(3) + 2(6) = 6
3k +12=6

For point (6,3):
K*5+9=7


From these calculations:
- Point (0,3): Works for all values of k.
- Point (2,0): Works for all values of k.
Therefore, points that must lie on the line for every possible value of k are (0,3), which is option B.

A farming field can be ploughed by 6 tractors in 4 days. When 6 tractors work together, each of them ploughs 120 hectares a day. If two of the tractors were moved to another field, then the remaining 4 tractors could plough the same field in 5 days. How many hectares a day would one tractor plough then?	"Rationale: Let's denote the rate at which one tractor ploughs a field in x hectares per day.

From the given information, we know that when 6 tractors work together, each of them ploughs 120 hectares a day. So, the total rate when all 6 tractors work together is 6 * 120 = 720 hectares per day.

We are also given that if two of the tractors were moved to another field, then the remaining 4 tractors could plough the same field in 5 days. This means that with only 4 tractors working, they can still complete the job at a rate of x hectares per day over those five days.

Therefore, for these four tractors working alone for five days to complete the job at a total rate of x hectares per day, we have:

4 * x * 5 = Total area plowed by four tractors in five days

Given that this total area is equal to what all six tractors would have done in four days (720), we can set up an equation:

4x * 5 = 720
20x = 720
x = \(\frac{720}{20}\)
x = \(36\)

Therefore, each tractor would"

"A cube shaped pool is half full of water. If the water is 36 inches deep, how much would the
water in the pool weigh if the pool were filled to the brim? (1 cubic foot weighs 56 pounds)"	"Rationale: 
The volume of the cube-shaped pool can be calculated using the formula V = s^3, where s is the side length of the cube. Since it is given that the pool is half full of water and the depth of water is 36 inches, we can find the side length of the cube as follows:

Let x be the side length of the cube.
Volume filled with water = (1/2) * x^2 * 36
Volume when completely filled = x^3

Given that 1 cubic foot weighs 56 pounds, we need to convert cubic inches to cubic feet:
1 cubic foot = 12*12*12 = 1728 cubic inches

Now, we can set up an equation to find x:
(1/2) * x^2 * 36 / 1728 = x^3 / 1728
Solving this equation will give us the value of x.

Once we have found x, we can calculate how much would the water in a completely filled pool weigh by finding its volume in cubic feet and then multiplying by weight per cubic foot.

Test Question: A cube-shaped pool is half full of water. If the water is 36 inches deep, how much would the water in a"

At an elite baseball camp, 60% of players can bat both right-handed and left-handed. If 1/3 of the players who bat left-handed do not bat right-handed, what is the probability that a player selected at random does not bat left-handed?	"Rationale: Let's break down the information given:
- 60% of players can bat both right-handed and left-handed.
- 1/3 of the players who bat left-handed do not bat right-handed.

Let's assume there are 100 players in total for easier calculations:
- 60 players can bat both ways.
- Let x be the number of players who can only bat left-handed, then (1/3)x cannot bat right-handed.

So, the total number of players who can't bat left-handed would be:
Total Players - (Players who can only bat left-handed) = 100 - x

Now we need to find out what percentage this is out of the total number of players (100):
Percentage = [(100 - x) / 100] * 100%

We know that x + 60 represents all the left-hand batters. Since it was given that they make up a third of all batters, we have:
x + 60 = (1/3)(x + 60)

Solving this equation gives us x = 40. So, there are a total of (100 - x) = 60 players who do not bat left-handed.

Plugging back into our percentage formula:
Percentage = [(100"

If the ratio of the ages of Maya and Chhaya is 6:5 at present, and fifteen years from now, the ratio will get changed to 9:8, then find Maya's present age.	"Rationale: Let's assume Maya's current age is 6x years and Chhaya's current age is 5x years.

After fifteen years, Maya's age will be (6x + 15) and Chhaya's age will be (5x + 15).

Given that the ratio of their ages after fifteen years will be 9:8, we can set up the equation:

(6x + 15) / (5x + 15) = 9 / 8

Cross multiplying, we get:

8(6x + 15) = 9(5x + 15)
48x + 120 =45 x+135
3 x= -15
So, x=-5

Maya's present age =6 * (-5)= -30

Since age cannot be negative, there seems to be an issue with the given information or calculation."

"Two trains under a controlled experiment begin at a speed of 100 mph in the opposite direction in a tunnel. A supersonic bee is left in the tunnel which can fly at a speed of 1000 mph. The tunnel is 200 miles long. When the trains start running on a constant speed of 100 mph, the supersonic bee starts flying from one train towards the other. As soon as the bee reaches the second train, it starts flying back towards the first train.
If the bee keeps flying to and fro in the tunnel till the trains collide, how much distance will it have covered in total?"	"Rationale: 
Let's first calculate the time it takes for the trains to collide. The relative speed of the two trains is 100 mph + 100 mph = 200 mph.

Time taken to collide = Distance / Relative speed
Time taken to collide = 200 miles / 200 mph
Time taken to collide = 1 hour

Now, let's consider the bee. The bee flies at a speed of 1000 mph and keeps flying back and forth between the two trains until they collide.

In one hour, the bee covers a total distance of:
Distance covered by bee in one hour = Speed * Time
Distance covered by bee in one hour = 1000 mph * 1 hour
Distance covered by bee in one hour = 1000 miles

Since the trains are moving towards each other at a combined speed of 200 mph, they will cover a distance of:
Total distance covered by both trains before collision = Relative speed * Time
Total distance covered by both trains before collision = 200 mph * 1 hour
Total distance covered by both trains before collision = 200 miles

Therefore, when the trains collide after an hour, the supersonic bee would have flown back and forth covering twice this distance.
Total distance covered by supersonic"

There are N numbers of gold biscuits in the house, in which four people are lived. If the first men woke up and divided the biscuits into 5 equal piles and found one extra biscuit. He took one of those piles along with the extra biscuit and hid them. He then gathered the 4 remaining piles into a big pile, woke up the second person and went to sleep. Each of the other 3 persons did the same one by one i.e. divided the big pile into 5 equal piles and found one extra biscuit. Each hid one of the piles along with the extra biscuit and gathered the remaining 4 piles into a big pile. If N>1000, what could be the least value of N?	"Rationale: Let's start by working through the problem step by step:

1. After the first person divides the biscuits into 5 equal piles, there is one extra biscuit. So, each pile will have (N/5) + 1 biscuits.

2. The first person takes one of those piles along with the extra biscuit, which means he took ((N/5) + 1) biscuits.

3. The remaining 4 piles are combined into a big pile, which now has 4 * ((N/5) + 1) = (4N/5) + 4 biscuits.

4. When the second person wakes up and divides this big pile into 5 equal piles, they find one extra biscuit as well. So each new pile will have ((4N/5) + 4)/5 + 1 = (4N/25) + (24/5).

5. The second person takes one of these new piles along with the extra biscuit, so they take ((4N/25) + (24/5)) biscuits.

6. The remaining 4 piles are combined again into a big pile, which now has 4 * (((4N/25) + (24/5))) ="

The least possible value of |89 - 9a|, where a is an integer, is	"Rationale: To find the least possible value of |89 - 9a|, we need to consider two cases:
1. When 89 - 9a ≥ 0, then |89 - 9a| = 89 - 9a
2. When 89 - 9a < 0, then |89 - 9a| = -(89 - 9a) = 9a - 89

For case (1):
When solving for when the expression is greater than or equal to zero:
89 - 9a ≥0
-9a ≥-89
Dividing by (-1), we get
=> a ≤ \(\frac{89}{9}\)
=> a ≤ \(8\frac{7}{9}\)

For case (2):
When solving for when the expression is less than zero:
\(8\frac{7}{9} < a < \infty\)

Therefore, the least possible value of |89 - 9a| occurs when a equals \(8\frac{7}{9}\), which gives us:
|89 - (8*10 + \(\frac{7}{3}\)) * (-1)| = |-1|
So, the least possible value of"

Santa distributes 2 gifts to every child in the street at the Christmas evening. He mistakenly gives 4 gifts to some children. If he distributed 50 gifts to 21 children. How many children got 4 gifts?	"Rationale: Let's denote the number of children who received 2 gifts as \(x\) and the number of children who received 4 gifts as \(y\).

From the given information, we know that:
1. Santa distributed a total of 50 gifts.
2. Each child who received 2 gifts got 2 gifts, and each child who received 4 gifts got 4 gifts.
3. There are a total of 21 children.

We can form two equations based on the above information:
1. \(2x + 4y = 50\) (Total number of gifts distributed)
2. \(x + y = 21\) (Total number of children)

Now, we need to solve these two equations simultaneously to find out how many children got 4 gifts.

Solving equation (2) for \(x\):
\(x = 21 - y\)

Substitute this value into equation (1):
\(2(21 - y) + 4y = 50\)
\(42 - 2y + 4y =50\)
\(42 +2y=50\)
\(2y=8\)
\(y=4 \)

Therefore, there were \(\boxed{D)4}\) children who"

Of two numbers, 4 times the smaller one is less then 3 times the larger one by 5. If the sum of the numbers is larger than 6 times their difference by 6, find the two numbers.	"Rationale: Let's denote the smaller number as \( x \) and the larger number as \( y \).

Given conditions:
1. \( 4x = 3y - 5 \)
2. \( x + y > 6(y - x) + 6 \)

From the first equation, we can rewrite it as \( 4x + 5 = 3y \) or equivalently, \( y = \frac{4x+5}{3} \).

Substitute this expression for \( y \) into the second equation:
\( x + \frac{4x+5}{3} > 6(\frac{4x+5}{3} - x) + 6 \\
3x + 4x + 5 > 24 - 6x +15 +6 \\
7x +5 > -6x +45 \\
13x >40 \\
\Rightarrow x>3.\overline{07}\)

Since both numbers are integers, let's try with \( x=4\) to satisfy all conditions.

For \( x=4\):
\( y = \frac{4*4+5}{3} =9\)

Therefore, the two numbers are $59$ and $63$.

M is a set of even numbers from 1 to 23 and odd numbers from 24 to 100. Find no. of zeroes in the sum of all values in the set.	"Rationale: To find the sum of all values in set M, we need to calculate the sum of even numbers from 1 to 23 and odd numbers from 24 to 100 separately.

For even numbers from 1 to 23:
The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula: Sum = (n/2)(first term + last term), where n is the number of terms.
In this case, there are (23-1)/2 + 1 = 12 even numbers.
The first even number is 2 and the last even number is 22.
Sum of even numbers = (12/2)(2 + 22) = 12 * 24 =288.

For odd numbers from 24 to 100:
Similarly, there are (100-24)/2 +1=39 odd numbers between them.
The first odd number is 25 and the last odd number is 99.
Sum of odd numbers = (39/2)(25+99) =19*124=2356.

Adding both sums together: 
Total sum=288+2356=2644

Now, counting the number of zeroes in this sum:
There are two zeroes in each multiple of ten. In our total sum, we have"
During a 10-week period, a doughnut store conducted a promotion by giving away one free doughnut with every doughnut purchased. If the store sold and gave away a total of K doughnuts per week, and each doughnut was sold for $0.25, how many dollars worth of doughnuts did the store give away?	"Rationale: Let's break down the information given in the question:
- During a 10-week period, a doughnut store conducted a promotion by giving away one free doughnut with every doughnut purchased.
- The store sold and gave away a total of K doughnuts per week.
- Each doughnut was sold for $0.25.

Since the promotion gives away one free doughnut with every purchase, for each paid doughnut sold at $0.25, there is another free one given away. This means that for every two doughnuts (one paid and one free), the store receives $0.25.

Therefore, if K represents the total number of both paid and free doughnuts sold per week, then the revenue from these sales would be 0.25 * (K/2) = 0.125K dollars worth of paid-for donuts.

However, we are interested in how many dollars worth of donuts did the store give away for free during this promotion. Since each pair of donuts consists of one paid ($0.25) and one free donut, the value of each pair is $0.25 + $0 = $0.25.

Thus, to find out how many dollars worth of donuts were given away"

"A salesman enters the quantity sold and the price into the computer. Both the numbers are two-digit numbers. But, by mistake, both the numbers were entered with their digits interchanged. The total sales value remained the same, i.e. Rs. 1,148, but the inventory reduced by 54.
What is the actual price per piece?"	"Rationale: Let the actual quantity sold be 10a + b and the actual price per piece be 10c + d. The total sales value is given as (10a + b)(10c + d) = 1148.

When the digits are interchanged, the new quantity sold becomes 10b + a and the new price per piece becomes 10d + c. The new total sales value is then (10b + a)(10d + c).

Given that both total sales values are equal, we have:
(10a + b)(10c + d) = (10b + a)(10d + c)
100ac - ad - bc = 100bd - ad - bc
100ac = 100bd
ac = bd

Since a, b, c, and d are all single-digit numbers, we can see that one pair of numbers must be {1,5} or {2,4}. However, since inventory reduced by 54 units when interchanging digits of quantity and price sold:

(11a - 11b) * (11c - 11d) = 54

The only possible combination for this to hold true is {2,4} for a,b,c,d which"

A girl counted in the following way on the fingers of her left hand : She started by calling the thumb 1, the index finger 2, middle finger 3, ring finger 4, little finger 5 and then reversed direction calling the ring finger 6, middle finger 7 and so on. She counted upto 1994. She ended counting on which finger ?	"Rationale: 
Let's break down the counting pattern to understand which finger the girl ended counting on:
- She started with thumb as 1, then index finger as 2, middle finger as 3, ring finger as 4, and little finger as 5.
- Then she reversed direction and continued from the ring finger as 6, middle finger as 7, and so on.

We can observe that each time she completes counting all fingers in one direction (from thumb to little finger or vice versa), she counts a total of five fingers. This means every fifth number will correspond to starting over in the opposite direction.

To find out which finger she ended counting on for the number 1994:
- Divide 1994 by 5 to see how many complete cycles of all fingers she counted through.
- The remainder will tell us where within that cycle she stopped.

Calculating this:
1994 ÷ 5 = Quotient of 398 with a remainder of 4

Since there is a remainder of 4 after dividing by five, it means that after completing full cycles up to some point within her last cycle when reaching her fourth count in reverse order (ring finger being the fourth), she stopped at the **Ring Finger**.

A 2 metre broad pathway is to be constructed around a rectangular plot on the inside. The area of the plots is 96 sq.m. The rate of construction is Rs. 50 per square metre. Find the total cost of the construction?	"Rationale: 
First, let's find the dimensions of the rectangular plot. Let the length be L meters and width be W meters.

Given that the area of the plot is 96 sq.m:
L * W = 96

Since a 2-meter broad pathway is constructed around the rectangular plot on the inside, new length = L + 4 and new width = W + 4.

The area of the new rectangle with pathway:
(L + 4)(W + 4) = LW + 4L + 4W + 16
= LW + (4L + 4W) + 16

Given that LW = 96, we substitute this back into our equation:
96 + (4L+4W) +16
=112 +(4L+4W)

Now, we know that perimeter of original rectangle = twice its length plus twice its width:
Perimeter =2(L+W)
But now with pathway added,
New Perimeter=2(L+6+W+6)=2(L+W)+24

We also know that Perimeter is equal to cost at Rs.50 per square meter.
So, Cost=(Perimeter)*50
Cost=24*50=Rs.1200

Therefore, total cost"

Of the new vehicles registered in a week, 300 were neither SUVs nor were they powered by diesel. 3/4th of the SUVs registered were diesel powered and there were half as many SUVs as there were non SUVs. If SUVs not powered by diesel were a sixth of non SUVs not powered by diesel, how many vehicles V registered in the week were powered by diesel?	"Rationale: Let's break down the information given in the question:
- Total new vehicles registered = V
- Vehicles that were neither SUVs nor diesel-powered = 300
- SUVs registered = S
- Non-SUVs registered = NS

From the given information:
1. \(S + NS = V\)
2. \(300 + S + NS = V\)

Given conditions:
1. \(\frac{3}{4}S\) were diesel-powered SUVs.
2. There were half as many SUVs as non-SUVs, so \(S = \frac{1}{2}NS\).
3. The number of SUVs not powered by diesel is a sixth of non-SUVs not powered by diesel, which means \(\frac{1}{6}(NS - \frac{3}{4}S) = S - \frac{3}{4}S\).

Let's solve for these equations step by step:

From condition 2: 
\(S = \frac{1}{2}NS\) 

Substitute this into equation 3:
\(\frac{1}{6}(NS - \frac{3}{4}\cdot\frac{1}{2}NS) = (\frac{1"

Three quarts of a bleaching chemical, Minum, contains 5 percent hydrogen peroxide and water. A different type of bleaching chemical, Maxim, which contains 20 percent hydrogen peroxide, will be mixed with the three quarts of Minum. How much of type Maxim should be added to the three quarts of Minum so that the resulting mixture contains 10 percent hydrogen peroxide?	"Rationale: Let's denote the amount of Maxim to be added in quarts as x.

In the initial mixture of Minum:
- Hydrogen peroxide content = 5% of 3 quarts = 0.05 * 3 = 0.15 quarts

In the final mixture after adding Maxim:
- Total volume of the mixture = 3 + x quarts
- Hydrogen peroxide content = (0.05 * 3 + 0.20x) / (3 + x)

According to the question, this hydrogen peroxide content should be equal to 10%:
(0.05 * 3 + 0.20x) / (3 + x) = 0.10

Solving for x:
(0.15 + 0.20x) / (3 + x) = 1/10
=> (15 + 20x) / (30 +10x) =1
=>15+20x=30+10x
=>10= -10x 
=> x=-1 quart

Since we cannot add a negative quantity, it means that no amount of Maxim can be added to achieve a resulting mixture containing exactly a hydrogen peroxide concentration of ten percent.

Eesha has a wheat business. She purchases wheat from a local wholesaler of a particular cost per pound. The price of the wheat of her stores is $3 per kg. Her faulty spring balance reads 0.9 kg for a KG. Also in the festival season, she gives a 10% discount on the wheat. She found that she made neither a profit nor a loss in the festival season. At what price did Eesha purchase the wheat from the wholesaler ?	"Rationale: Let's break down the given information:
- The price at which Eesha sells the wheat is $3 per kg.
- Her spring balance reads 0.9 kg for a KG, meaning she gives 0.9 kg for every 1 kg.
- During the festival season, she offers a 10% discount on the wheat.

Let x be the cost price of wheat per kg from the wholesaler.

During the festival season, Eesha sells at $3/kg but actually gives only 0.9kg for every 1kg due to her faulty balance. So, effectively she is selling at $\frac{3}{0.9} = \frac{30}{9} = \frac{10}{3}$ dollars per actual kilogram.

Since there is no profit or loss during the festival season, this selling price after a 10% discount should be equal to her cost price from the wholesaler:

$\left(1 - \frac{10}{100}\right) \times \left(\frac{10}{3}\right)x = x$

Solving this equation will give us:

$\frac{9}{10} \times \frac{10x}{3} = x$

The steamer going upstream would cover the distance between Town A and Town B in 5 hours. The same steamer going downstream would cover the distance between the towns in 3 hours. How long would it take a raft moving at the speed of the current to float from B to A?	"Rationale: Let the speed of the steamer be S and the speed of the current be C.

When going upstream (against the current), the effective speed is (S - C) and it takes 5 hours to cover the distance between Town A and Town B. So, we have:

Distance = Speed x Time
=> Distance = (S - C) x 5

When going downstream (with the current), the effective speed is (S + C) and it takes 3 hours to cover the same distance. So, we have:

Distance = Speed x Time
=> Distance = (S + C) x 3

Since both expressions represent the same distance between Town A and Town B, we can equate them:

(S - C) x 5 = (S + C) x 3
Expanding this equation gives:
5S - 5C = 3S + 3C
2S = 8C
=> S/C = 4/1

This means that for every unit increase in speed, there is a corresponding unit increase in current speed.

Now, let's consider a raft moving at only the speed of the current. This means its speed would be equal to just C.

The population of a city increases at the rate of 4% per annum. There is an additional annual increase of 1% in the population due to the influx of job seekers. Therefore, the % increase in the population after 2 years will be :	"Rationale: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The population increases at a rate of 4% per annum.
2. There is an additional annual increase of 1% in the population due to job seekers.
3. After 2 years, we need to calculate the total percentage increase in the population.

Let's calculate this step by step:

Let's assume the initial population is 100 for easier calculations.

After 1 year:
Population after a 4% increase = $100 + (4/100) * $100 = $104
Additional increase due to job seekers = (1/100) * $104 = $1.04
Total population after 1 year = $104 + $1.04 = $105.04

After another year:
Population after a further 4% increase = $105.04 + (4/100) * $105.04 ≈ $109.22

The sum of 3rd and 15th elements of an arithmetic progression is equal to the sum of the 6th, 11th and 13th elements of the same progression. Then, which element of the series should necessarily be equal to zero ?	"Rationale: Let's denote the common difference of the arithmetic progression as \(d\).

The 3rd element of the arithmetic progression is \(a + 2d\) and the 15th element is \(a + 14d\).
Similarly, the 6th element is \(a + 5d\), the 11th element is \(a + 10d\), and the 13th element is \(a + 12d\).

Given that:
\( (a+2d) + (a+14d) = (a+5d) + (a+10d) + (a+12d)\)
\(2a +16d =3(a)+27 d \)
\( a=11 d \)

Therefore, we can rewrite our terms in terms of 'd':
3rd term: \(11 d\) 
15th term: \(11 d+14 d=25 d\) 
6th term:   \(11 d+5 d=16 d\) 
11th term:   \(11 d+10 d=21 d\) 
13th term:   \(11 d+12 d=23 D\) 

From above equation, we get
\(25D =60D => D=-"

At an amusement park, tom bought a number of red tokens and green tokens. Each red token costs $0.05, and each green token costs $0.14. If Tom spent a total of exactly $2.06, how many token in total did Tom buy?	"Rationale: Let the number of red tokens Tom bought be \(x\) and the number of green tokens be \(y\).

The total cost equation can be represented as:
\(0.05x + 0.14y = 2.06\)

Given that the total amount spent is $2.06, we need to find the values of \(x\) and \(y\) such that this equation holds true.

To solve for \(x\) and \(y\), we can use a systematic approach like substitution or elimination method:

1. Multiply the entire equation by 100 to get rid of decimals:
\(5x + 14y = 206\)

2. Since there are no other constraints given in the problem, we have an infinite number of solutions for this system of equations.

3. We can start by trying different combinations until we find a solution that satisfies both conditions (total cost and whole numbers for tokens).

Let's try some possible combinations:
- If Tom buys 20 green tokens (\(y = 20\)), then substituting into the equation gives us:
\(5x + 14*20 = 206 \Rightarrow x = \frac{206 - 280}{5} \Rightarrow x = -14/5\)

A fisherman's day is rated as good if he catches 9 fishes, fair if he catches 7 fishes and poor if he catches 5 fishes. The fisherman catches 53 fishes in a week that includes good, fair and poor days. How many good days the fisherman had during the week?	"Rationale: Let's represent the number of good, fair, and poor days as G, F, and P respectively. We are given that:
G + F + P = 7 (total number of days in a week)
9G + 7F + 5P = 53 (total number of fishes caught)

From the first equation, we can express P in terms of G and F:
P = 7 - G - F

Substitute this into the second equation:
9G + 7F + 5(7 - G - F) = 53
9G + 7F + 35 - 5G - 5F = 53
4G +2F =18
2G+F=9

Now we need to find out how many good days (G) the fisherman had during the week. To do this, let's try different values for G starting from option A:

A) If there was only one good day (G=1), then there would be:
2(1)+F=9 => F=7

So, with one good day and seven fair days, total fishes caught would be: 
9*1+7*7+5*(7-1-1"

A, B and C start at the same time in the same direction to run around a circular stadium. A completes a round in 252 seconds, B in 308 seconds and c in 198 seconds, all starting at the same point. After what time will they again at the starting point ?	"Rationale: To find the time when A, B, and C will meet again at the starting point, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their individual times taken to complete one round around the circular stadium.

Given:
Time taken by A = 252 seconds
Time taken by B = 308 seconds
Time taken by C = 198 seconds

We need to calculate LCM(252, 308, 198).

Step 1: Prime factorize each number:
- Prime factors of 252 are 2^2 * 3^2 * 7
- Prime factors of 308 are 2^2 * 7 * 11
- Prime factors of 198 are 2 *3^2*11

Step 2: Identify the highest power of each prime factor present in any of the numbers:
- Highest power of prime factor '2' is '2^2'
- Highest power of prime factor '3' is '3^2'
- Prime factor '7' is present in both numbers as it is.
- Prime factor '11' is present in only one number.

Step 3: Calculate LCM:

A, B and C are three contestants in a 1000 m race. If A finishes the race 40 m ahead of B and 64 m ahead of C, how much did each of them cover at that time?	"Rationale: Let's denote the distance covered by A, B, and C as \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) respectively.

From the given information:
1. A finishes 40m ahead of B: \(x = y + 40\)
2. A finishes 64m ahead of C: \(x = z + 64\)

We also know that the total distance covered by all three contestants is 1000m:
\(x + y + z = 1000\)

Substitute the first two equations into the third equation:
\(y + 40 + y + z + 64 = 1000\)
\(2y + z = 896\) 

Now we need to find a combination where when B covers a certain distance, C covers a certain distance.
Let's try each option:

A) When B covers 890 m, C covers (890 - x) - (866 - z) m
B) When B covers 860 m, C covers (860 - x) - (836 - z) m
C) When B covers 930 m, C covers (930 - x) - (906 - z) m
D) When B covers 960 m, C covers ("
At a delivery store, seven packages have an average (arithmetic mean) weight of 222 kg and a median weight of 270 kg. What is the maximum possible weight, in kilograms, of the lightest package?	"Rationale: Let's denote the weights of the seven packages as \(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6,\) and \(a_7\), where \(a_i\) represents the weight of package i.

We know that the median weight is 270 kg. Since there are 7 packages arranged in ascending order by weight, the median will be the weight of the fourth package. So, we have \(a_4 = 270\).

The average weight is given as 222 kg. The average of these weights can be calculated as \(\frac{a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a _6+ a _7}{7} = 222\). 

Since all weights are different and we want to find the maximum possible weight for the lightest package (which would be \(a1\)), we should minimize all other weights except for \(a4\) to maximize \(a1\).

Let's assume that all other weights are minimum:
\(a1 = x\), 
\(x+a2+x+270+x+a4+x+a5+x+a6=222*7\) (sum of all weights"

If a rectangular box has two faces with an area of 25, two faces of area 50, and two faces of area 72, what is its volume?	"Rationale: 
Let's denote the dimensions of the rectangular box as length (l), width (w), and height (h). 

Given that two faces have an area of 25, we can write lw = 25. This gives us one equation.

Similarly, for two faces with an area of 50, we have lh = 50, giving us another equation.

And for two faces with an area of 72, we get wh = 72, providing a third equation.

Now let's solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of l, w, and h:

From lw = 25 and lh = 50:
w = 25/l
h = 50/l

Substitute these into wh = 72:
(25/l)(50/l) = 72
1250/l^2 = 72
l^2 ≈1250/72
l^2 ≈17.36
l ≈ √17.36 ≈4.17

Now substitute back to find w and h:
w ≈25/4.17 ≈6
h ≈50/4.17≈12

Finally, calculate the volume V= lwh:
V ≈4.17*6*"

Consider a courier company A which can deliver 100 parcels in 5 days with 5 men working for 8 hours a day. Consider another courier company B where every employee is equally efficient as that of company B. Company B is short of one man when compared to A and has a policy of asking its workers to work only for 6 hours a day. How long (in days) company B will take to deliver 100 parcels.	"Rationale: Let's first find the total work hours required to deliver 100 parcels by company A. 

Total work hours for company A = 5 days * 8 hours/day * 5 men = 200 man-hours

Now, let's find the efficiency ratio of company B compared to company A:
- Company A has 5 men working for 8 hours a day
- Company B has one less man but works for only 6 hours a day
- So, the efficiency ratio of B to A = (4 men * 6 hours) / (5 men * 8 hours) = (24 man-hours) / (40 man-hours) = 3/5

Since company B is only \(\frac{3}{5}\) as efficient as company A, it will take longer to complete the same amount of work.

Let x be the number of days required for company B to deliver 100 parcels.
So, Total work hours for company B = x days * 6 hours/day * 4 men

As both companies are delivering the same amount of work (100 parcels), we can equate their total work hours:
200 = x*6*4
x=50/24=25/12=2.08 days"

Davji Shop sells samosas in boxes of different sizes. The samosas are priced at Rs. 2 per samosa up to 200 samosas. For every additional 20 samosas, the price of the whole lot goes down by 10 paise per samosa. What should be the maximum size of the box that would maximise the revenue?	"Rationale: To maximize revenue, we need to find the optimal number of samosas in a box that would generate the highest income. Let's calculate the revenue for different box sizes:

Let's denote:
- x as the number of samosas priced at Rs. 2 per samosa (up to 200 samosas)
- y as the additional number of samosas beyond 200

The price per samosa after the first 200 is Rs. (2 - y*0.10) per samosa.

The total revenue can be calculated as:
Total Revenue = (Price per samosa * Total Number of Samosas)

For x ≤ 200, each costs Rs. 2.
For y > 0, each costs Rs. (2 - y*0.10).

Therefore, Total Revenue = [x * 2 + y * (2 - y*0.10)]

We know that x + y should be less than or equal to some maximum box size N.

To maximize revenue, we need to find d(Total Revenue)/dy = 0 and check for maximum value.

Differentiating with respect to 'y' and setting it equal to zero gives us:
d(Total Revenue)/dy = -0.20y + 2"

"Fernando Alonso and Sebastian Vettel go for a car race. Before the start of race, both of them have the exactly same amount of fuel in their respective cars. With the given fuel Fernando can drive continuously for 4 hours while Vettel can drive 1 hour more.
After some time they realize that amount of fuel left in Sebastian car is 4 times the fuel in Fernando car.
For long have they been racing ?"	"Rationale: Let's assume that Fernando can drive at a rate of \( x \) fuel units per hour and Vettel can drive at a rate of \( y \) fuel units per hour.

Given that Fernando can drive continuously for 4 hours, the amount of fuel he has is \( 4x \).
Vettel, on the other hand, can drive for 1 more hour than Fernando, so his total driving time is 5 hours. The amount of fuel Vettel has is \( 5y \).

It's given that after some time they realize that the amount of fuel left in Sebastian's car is 4 times the fuel in Fernando's car:
\[ 5y = 4(4x) \]
\[ 5y =16x \]

Now we need to find how long they have been racing. This would be when both cars had equal amounts of fuel left:
\[ (4 - t)x = (5 - t)y \]
where \( t \) represents the time they've been racing.

Substitute the values from above into this equation:
\[ (4 - t)x = (5 - t)(\frac{16}{5}x) \]
Solve for \( t \):
\[ (4-t)x ="

Find the cost of carpeting a room 13 m long and 9 m broad with a carpet 75 cm wide at the rate of Rs. 12.40 per square metre.	"Rationale: 
First, we need to find the area of the room that needs to be carpeted. The room is 13m long and 9m broad, so the total area is \(13 \times 9 = 117\) square meters.

Next, we need to consider the width of the carpet which is given as 75 cm or 0.75 m. So, when carpeting a room with a width of 0.75 m, each strip will cover an area of \(13 \times 0.75 = 9.75\) square meters.

Now, we calculate how many such strips are needed to cover the entire length of the room:
\(\frac{117}{9.75} = 12\)

Therefore, we need 12 strips of carpet along the length of the room.

The cost per square meter is given as Rs.12.40.
So, for covering one strip (9.75 sq.m), it would cost \(9.75 \times Rs.\)12.40

Hence, for covering all twelve strips:
\(12 \times (9.75 \times Rs.\)12.40)

Calculating this gives us:
\(12 \times (1192) = Rs.\)"
The ratio of a numerator to denominator is 2:3. If six is subtracted from the numerator, the new fraction is now 2/3 of the original fraction. Find the numerator.'	"Rationale: Let's denote the numerator as 2x and the denominator as 3x. 

Given that if six is subtracted from the numerator, the new fraction is now 2/3 of the original fraction:
(2x - 6) / (3x) = (2/3)

Cross multiply to solve for x:
3(2x - 6) = 2 * 3x
6x - 18 = 6x
-18 = 0

This equation has no solution, which means there might be a mistake in setting up or interpreting the problem."
"At a casino, gamblers spin a number-wheel containing positive, two-digit numbers. If the gambler bets on a prime number, he/she will win 2 times their bet, if the wheel shows that number. If the gambler bets on a non-prime number, he/she only wins half their bet, if the wheel shows that number. If a gambler won $100, which of the choices is possible?
I. bet $50 on 11
II. bet $50 on 21
III. bet $200 on 89"	"Rationale: 
To solve this problem, we need to determine the outcomes of each bet and see which one is possible based on the given conditions.

Let's analyze each option:
I. Betting $50 on 11:
- 11 is a prime number, so if the wheel shows 11, the gambler will win 2 times their bet.
- Possible outcome: Gambler wins $100 (2 * $50) if the wheel shows 11.

II. Betting $50 on 21:
- 21 is not a prime number, so if the wheel shows 21, the gambler will only win half their bet.
- Possible outcome: Gambler wins $25 (0.5 * $50) if the wheel shows 21.

III. Betting $200 on 89:
- Since we know that gamblers spin a number-wheel containing positive two-digit numbers and prime numbers are two-digit numbers, it's not possible for them to bet on a three-digit number like 89 in this scenario.

Therefore, based on our analysis:
- Option I (betting $50 on 11) results in winning exactly $100.
- Option II (betting $50 on 21) results in winning only $25.
- Option III ("

A picks a number from the bag where the bag consists of numbers from {1,2....23} and puts it in the same bag. Now, another person B picks a number from the bag. Find the probability that A has picked a greater number than B?	"Rationale: 
Let's consider the possible outcomes when A picks a number from the bag. There are 23 numbers in total, and each number has an equal probability of being picked by A.

1. If A picks the number 1, then there are 22 numbers left in the bag.
2. If A picks the number 2, then there are still 22 numbers left in the bag.
3. This pattern continues until if A picks the number 23, then there is only one number left in the bag.

Therefore, for each number that A picks, there are (23 - 1) = 22 numbers that B can pick which are less than what A picked.

So, total favorable outcomes = 22 * 23 (since there are 23 possible numbers that could be picked by A)

Total possible outcomes = Total ways to pick a number from {1,2,...23} twice = $^{23}C_1 \times ^{24}C_1$

Now we can calculate the probability:

Probability = Favorable outcomes / Total outcomes
Probability = (22 * 23) / ($^{23}C_1 \times ^{24}C_1)
Probability = (506) / (552)

A green lizard can travel from the green cave to the blue cave in 72 minutes; the blue lizard can travel from the blue cave to the green cave in 25% less time. If the green lizard started to travel 5.5 minutes before the blue lizard, how many minutes after the blue lizard, will the green lizard pass the middle line?	"Rationale: Let's break down the information given in the question:
- Green lizard travels from green cave to blue cave in 72 minutes.
- Blue lizard can travel from blue cave to green cave in 25% less time, which is \(0.25 \times 72 = 18\) minutes less than the green lizard.

Now, let's denote:
- Time taken by the blue lizard to travel from blue cave to green cave as \(x\) minutes.
- Time taken by the green lizard to pass the middle line after starting as \(y\) minutes.

Given that the green lizard started traveling 5.5 minutes before the blue lizard, we can set up an equation based on their relative speeds:

\(\frac{y + 5.5}{72} = \frac{y}{x}\)

Since we know that blue lizard takes 18 minutes less than green lizard for a similar distance:

\(x = 72 - 18 = 54\) minutes

Substitute this value of \(x\) into our equation and solve for \(y\):

\(\frac{y + 5.5}{72} = \frac{y}{54}\)

Solving this equation gives us \(y = \frac{216}{11} \"

Consider a school which consists of boys, girls and one teacher. There twice as many girls as boys. During prayer, this school follows a procedure where people bows to each other. Each girl and boy is required to bow to other girls, boys and their teacher. Each day 900 bows are completed. Find how many boys there are in the school ?	"Rationale: Let's assume the number of boys in the school is x. Since there are twice as many girls as boys, the number of girls would be 2x.

Each girl bows to other girls, boys, and their teacher. So each girl makes (2x + x + 1) = 3x+1 bows.

Similarly, each boy bows to other girls, boys, and their teacher. So each boy makes (2x + 2) = 2x+2 bows.

Given that each day 900 bows are completed:
Total number of bows made by girls + Total number of bows made by boys = Total number of bows completed
(3x+1)*2x + (2x+2)*x = 900
Solving this equation:
6x^2 + 2x + 4x^2 + 4 = 900
10x^2 + 6x -896 =0

Now we need to solve this quadratic equation to find the value of x which represents the number of boys in the school.
By solving this equation using a quadratic formula or factoring method, we get x ≈ -18 or x ≈8.96

Since the number of boys cannot be negative and"
"I have an amazing bath tub having both hot and cold water taps.
The cold water tap can fill my tub in 6 hours while cold water tap can fill the tub in approximately 4 hours.
I turned them on simultaneously but forgot to close the lid which removes the water out of tub.
The lid can empty the tub in exact 13 hours.
Since both taps are open along with the lib, can you estimate the time needed to fill the bath tub?"	"Rationale: Let's denote the rate at which the hot water tap fills the tub as H, and the rate at which the cold water tap fills the tub as C. We can calculate their rates based on how long each tap takes to fill the tub individually.

From given information:
Hot water tap fills in 6 hours -> Rate of hot water tap (H) = 1/6
Cold water tap fills in 4 hours -> Rate of cold water tap (C) = 1/4

When both taps are open simultaneously, their rates add up:
Combined rate = H + C = 1/6 + 1/4 = 5/12

Now, we need to consider that while both taps are filling the tub, the lid is also emptying it. The lid empties in 13 hours, so its rate is -1/13 (negative because it's removing water).

Net rate when all three are working together:
Net rate = Combined rate - Lid's emptying rate
Net rate = 5/12 - 1/13
Net rate = (65 - 12) /156
Net rate = 53 /156

Time needed to fill the bathtub with all three working together:
Time = 1 /"
